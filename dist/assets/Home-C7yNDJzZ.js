Climate change is leading to a rise in nighttime warming, which is impacting sleep quality and human health in India and across the globe, said the analysis by Climate Central and Climate Trends. ADVERTISEMENT Nighttime temperatures have increased even more rapidly than daytime temperatures as the world heats up due to climate change, primarily caused by burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas. As one of the countries most vulnerable to the impacts of the climate crisis, India has experienced a significant rise in minimum nighttime temperatures over the last decade due to climate change. The national capital on June 18 experienced its warmest night in at least 12 years, with the mercury touching 35.2 degrees Celsius, says the India Meteorological Department. This is the city's highest minimum temperature since 1969. The analysis shows that nearly 50 to 80 days each year were added above this threshold by climate change in cities across Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir, and Andhra Pradesh between 2018 and 2023. Among the metro cities, Mumbai has seen the highest changes in the nighttime temperatures, with the city experiencing an additional 65 days of warmer nights due to global warming. West Bengal and Assam are the regions that have been most impacted, with cities like Jalpaiguri, Guwahati, Silchar, Dibrugarh and Siliguri experiencing between 80 and 86 additional days each year above the 25 degrees threshold due to climate change, on average. Several cities saw between 15 and 50 additional days where the minimum temperatures exceeded 25 degrees due to the influence of climate change, including Jaipur, with an additional 19 hot nights attributable to climate change. Meanwhile, in both observations and in the counterfactual climate, the nighttime summer temperatures across India often exceed 20 degrees over the entire summer period. The cities that had the largest number of days where the minimum temperature exceeded 20 degrees due to climate change are Gangtok, Darjeeling, Shimla, and Mysore, with an average of 54, 31, 30, and 26 days added by climate change, respectively. Higher nighttime temperatures can cause physiological discomfort and impact human health by preventing body temperature from cooling off during the night, increasing mortality risks. There is also a growing body of evidence that as nighttime temperatures rise, it is adversely affecting the quality and length of sleep. Poor sleep adversely affects physical and mental health, cognitive functioning and even life expectancy. Hot nights can have disproportionate impacts on vulnerable groups, including the elderly and people, who do not have access to proper cooling mechanisms. These findings come during a week that saw new records for nighttime heat in several Indian cities. On June 19, Delhi shattered the all-time high minimum temperature record, with the mercury reaching 35.2 degrees overnight. Delhi recorded almost four numbers of additional nights over 25 degrees between 2018 and 2023, according to the Climate Central analysis. On June 18, Alwar in Rajasthan had a minimum temperature of 37 degrees, the highest-ever nighttime temperature since records began in 1969. Alwar experienced almost nine additional nights over 25 degrees that are attributable to climate change between 2018 and 2023. In Uttar Pradesh, Lakhimpur Kheri, Shahjahanpur and Varanasi also witnessed their highest recorded minimum temperatures at 33 degrees, 33 and 33.6 degrees respectively this week. Varanasi saw four additional nights over 25 degrees due to climate change from 2018 to 2023. These increasingly frequent extreme nighttime temperatures are contributing to heat stress, exhaustion and heat-related deaths. The current ongoing heatwave in India has been made hotter, frequent and more likely by climate change, according to scientific studies by World Weather Attribution and ClimaMeter. Roxy Mathew Koll, Climate Scientist, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, \\"The urban heat island effect is most visible in the nighttime temperatures. Cities turn into urban heat islands when buildings, roads, and other infrastructure absorb and re-emit heat, causing cities to be several degrees hotter than surrounding rural areas.\\" \\"During the day, the sun's rays reach as shortwave radiation and heat the earth's surface. At night, the heat escapes as longwave radiation. While shortwave radiation can easily penetrate through and reach the surface, the longwave gets trapped easily by concrete and clouds.\\" Aarti Khosla, Director, of Climate Trends, said, \\"Like day temperatures, night temperatures have also shown constant and steady rise over the last few years. Warm nights have been punishing this summer with several cities shattering five decades of records. Cities will bear the highest brunt which will get worse due to the urban heat island effect.\\" \\"Several studies have already established that by the turn of the century, without very large reductions in fossil fuel burning, nighttime temperatures will not fall below 25 degrees in some places during hot weather impacting one's ability to recover for the next day. If we do not act now, nights will continue to be hotter, longer and sleepless, especially for the vulnerable.\\"","pubDate":"2024-06-21 05:29:04","image_url":"https://images.mid-day.com/images/images/2024/jun/SleepDayistock_d.jpg","source_id":"mid_day","source_priority":4893,"source_url":"https://www.mid-day.com","source_icon":"https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/mid_day.png","language":"english","country":"india","category":"lifestyle","ai_tag":"climate and weather","ai_region":"india,asia","ai_org":null,"sentiment":"neutral","sentiment_stats":"positive:2.68,neutral:95.46,negative:1.86"},{"article_id":"1b420c08ed53b901e1ae87bf2198530f","title":"Maharashtra plans high-rise prison in Mankhurd to combat overcrowding","link":"https://www.mid-day.com/mumbai/mumbai-news/article/maharashtra-plans-high-rise-prison-in-mankhurd-to-combat-overcrowding-23355121","keywords":"mumbai","creator":"Mid-day","video_url":null,"description":"According to sources, a few months ago, the long-awaited 5-acre land in Mandala, Mankhurd was acquired by the state, and construction is likely to begin after discussions with the concerned department","content":"The is studying the multi-story prisons in Chicago, China, and Singapore to finalize the blueprint for a highly anticipated high-rise prison in the Mankhurd area.

This will help us reduce overcrowding in prisons across Maharashtra, which is currently higher than its actual capacity,” said Amitabh Gupta, ADG Prison. ADVERTISEMENT The Maharashtra Housing Department, which will construct the prison on the 5-acre land in Mandala, is studying the blueprints of multi-story prisons worldwide, particularly those in China, Singapore, and Chicago. \\"We are not accustomed to multi-story prisons, so it is crucial for us to understand how they function, how to handle inmates, provide various facilities, and move them within the facility. The construction will be different from a standard building, which is why we are studying blueprints from different prisons around the world,\\" said an officer of the . The officials also said that they are also studying to use the full FSI or leave some open space for the sports facilities of the prisoners. As per the data, Maharashtra currently has 60 prisons which has a capacity of 27,931 inmates but it houses 40,428 inmates. As According to the data, prisons in Mumbai are also overcrowded, and many bail applications pending in courts are for non-serious offences. Official data shows that Arthur Road Jail in Mumbai, with a capacity of 999 inmates, houses 3,700. in Navi Mumbai has a capacity of 2,100 but holds 2,800 prisoners. Similarly, Thane Jail, with a capacity of 1,100, and Kalyan Jail, with a capacity of 505, accommodate 3,000 and 2,800 inmates, respectively. “Overcrowding has been a serious concern in Mumbai, and we have been raising this issue with the concerned departments, including the legal department. Also, we need to ensure that bail is granted in cases involving non-serious offences. This would help create more space inside the prisons,” an officer said on the condition of anonymity. “In non-serious cases, it is noticed that a huge amount of under-trials are languishing in jails. The norm of bail is the rule; jail is the exception, is unfortunately not being implemented in letter and spirit and the ground reality is a stark reminder. Corruption is rampant in Jails which is common knowledge. The Jails are hugely congested leading to fights even for crumbs. The Supreme Court has repeatedly expressed concern about the overcrowding of jails all over India. It is the duty of Courts, prosecutors and the concerned Government Authorities to conduct immediate surveys, jail which will reveal that hundreds of men and women are languishing for various reasons. The Trials are taking lots of years to even commence and it is the duty of all concerned to act swiftly as more the undertrial remains in the dangerous company even reform would be a remote dream, which is disastrous for our society also,” said senior lawyer, Dr. Sujay Kantawala.","pubDate":"2024-06-21 05:29:03","image_url":"https://images.mid-day.com/images/images/2024/jun/prisoner_d.jpg","source_id":"mid_day","source_priority":4893,"source_url":"https://www.mid-day.com","source_icon":"https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/mid_day.png","language":"english","country":"india","category":"top","ai_tag":"real estate","ai_region":"mankhurd,maharashtra,india,asia,mandala,gujarat,india,asia,maharashtra,india,asia","ai_org":null,"sentiment":"negative","sentiment_stats":"positive:14.52,neutral:2.05,negative:83.43"},{"article_id":"727ce0e888d3e4192e725c3836f9db08","title":"Japan vs England: Date, kick-off time, how to watch, team news, lineups, venue, odds and h2h results","link":"https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/rugby/japan-vs-england-date-kick-off-time-tv-channel-live-stream-team-news-lineups-odds-b1165519.html","keywords":"rugby union,sport","creator":"George Flood","video_url":null,"description":"Summer Tokyo clash serves as warm up for New Zealand series as Steve Borthwick’s side come up against former boss Eddie Jones","content":"Sport | Rugby Union England warm up for New Zealand as they kick off their summer tour against Japan this weekend. Steve Borthwick’s side have two tough clashes against the formidable All Blacks to come in Dunedin on July 6 and Auckland on July 13, but first they head to Tokyo for their first-ever rugby Test match against the Brave Blossoms on Japanese soil - scene of the 2019 World Cup, where they lost agonisingly to South Africa in the final in Yokohama. The presence of Eddie Jones back as Japan head coach adds another intriguing subplot to Saturday’s showdown, with the former long-serving England boss having been confirmed in the role back in December only two months after resigning from Australia following a dismal World Cup campaign. England have named a strong side to face Japan and will want to make a statement in advance of that series in New Zealand, having followed up their shock run to the World Cup semi-finals in France in the autumn with an improved Six Nations performance in which they spoiled Ireland’s dreams of back-to-backs Grand Slams before almost overcoming France in a last-day thriller in Paris. They also edged out early wins over Italy and Wales before being bested again by Scotland in the Calcutta Cup, having seen influential captain Owen Farrell stand down from international duty in a bid to prioritise his mental health. Japan - who also have Georgia and Italy on their summer schedule before a tricky autumn series in which they play New Zealand, France and England again, this time at Twickenham - beat Tonga last summer to go with losses to Samoa, Fiji and Italy, going on to finish third in their pool at the World Cup to ensure qualification for the 2027 tournament. The Brave Blossoms beat both Chile and Samoa, though lost to Argentina and fell to a scrappy 34-12 defeat by England in Nice , where Lewis Ludlam, Courtney Lawes, Freddie Steward and Joe Marchant all scored tries to go along with 14 points from the boot of George Ford. The one-off summer Test match between Japan and England takes place on Saturday June 22, 2024, with kick-off scheduled for 2:50pm local time - which is 6:50am BST in the UK.

England are also without the likes of Ellis Genge this summer, with six uncapped players in the wider tour squad in Roebuck, Ollie Sleightholme, Fin Baxter, Luke Northmore, Gabriel Oghre and Joe Carpenter. Japan have named a very inexperienced team as Jones switches his attention to youth , with Waseda University student Yoshitaka Yazaki - who has yet to make his first-class debut - handed a shock start at full-back. Captain Michael Leitch, centre Dylan Riley and scrum-half Naoto Saito are the only three players starting who also began Japan’s last World Cup game against Argentina in October. Japan XV: Yazaki; Naikabula, Riley, Osada, Nezuka; Lee, Sato; Mohara, Harada, Takeuchi; Waqa, Dearns; Leitch (c), Costley, Makisi Replacements: Sakate, Miura, Tamefusa, Saumaki, Yamamoto, Fujiwara, Matsuda, Tua England XV: Furbank; Feyi-Waboso, Slade, Lawrence, Freeman; M Smith, Mitchell; Rodd, George (c) Cole; Itoje, Martin; Cunningham-South, Underhill, Earl Replacements: Dan, Marler, Stuart, Ewels, T Curry, Randall, F Smith, Roebuck England have never previously lost to Japan in eight previous meetings between the two nations. Their most recent clash was at the Rugby World Cup in Nice last September, when England ran in four tries in a scrappy 34-12 pool stage victory. How England would love to get one over on old boss Jones this weekend. This is the first time they have come up against the outspoken Australian since he was sacked by RFU bosses following seven years in charge at Twickenham in December 2022. After an improved Six Nations and impressive World Cup that busted all expectations that had sunk so low after such a woeful summer, England have to keep evolving and building under Borthwick in another new cycle. They are missing a lot of experience this summer both in terms of retired players, overseas absentees and injuries, but rugby challenges do not come much tougher than battling the All Blacks in New Zealand and it is essential they have the best possible preparations if they are to spring a shock in the Land of the Long White Cloud next month. That starts with what has to be a commanding win over a Japan team beginning a new era with Jones back at the helm, provided they cope with what are expected to be extremely hot and humid conditions in Tokyo. England to win by at least 15 points. Japan to win: 11/1 England to win: 1/20 Draw: 50/1 Odds via Betfair (subject to change).

Grande announced the remix earlier this week on social media, writing, “I ......... cannot believe this is real (i don’t know if i will even long after it’s out).” The “7 Rings” singer also thanked Brandy and Monica, “not only for joining me for this moment, but for your generosity, your kindness, and for the countless ways in which you have inspired me.” “It is near impossible to say how much this means to me,” she added. “This is in celebration of you both and the impact that you have had on every vocalist, vocal producer, musician, artist that is creating today.” On Friday, following the remix’s release, Brandy posted a link to the song on X and wrote: “Love you Ariana Thank you for embracing us with so much warmth and kindness. Overjoyed to celebrate this moment with you and @MonicaDenise.” The 1998 track spent 13 week at Number One on the Billboard Hot 100 following its release. The two R&B greats also made cameos in Grande’s music video of the reimagined track , which also features Penn Badgley alongside a slick Catwoman-like Grande. Grande released her seventh album, Eternal Sunshine , in March. In Rolling Stone ‘s review, writer Brittany Spanos called “The Boy Is Mine” a “late Nineties, early Aughts R&B-pop moment.” When describing her latest LP, Spanos wrote that the project sees Grande navigate “a new beginning with some of the most honest and inventive songs of her career so far.”","pubDate":"2024-06-21 05:25:21","image_url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/the-boy-is-mine-ariana-grande-brandy-monica.jpg?w=1581&h=1054&crop=1","source_id":"rollingstone","source_priority":289,"source_url":"https://www.rollingstone.com","source_icon":"https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/rollingstone.png","language":"english","country":"united states of america","category":"entertainment","ai_tag":"celebrity","ai_region":null,"ai_org":null,"sentiment":"neutral","sentiment_stats":"positive:31.42,neutral:67.02,negative:1.57"},{"article_id":"72ec3785a9c0f2edb8764b0f62ee6831","title":"Royal news - live: Harry and Meghan Markle ‘reach out’ to Kate Middleton as ‘homesick’ prince eyes UK home","link":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/harry-meghan-kate-william-royal-family-news-b2566394.html","keywords":"uk,home news","creator":"Emma Guinness","video_url":null,"description":"The Princess of Wales hopes to attend more events this summer","content":"Meghan Markle and Prince Harry have reportedly “reached out” to the Princess of Wales amid her ongoing cancer battle.

Kacie Stephens walks through thousands of properties every year to do a regular service or a once-off end-of-lease clean. One of the most common things she has noticed during bond cleaning services is that tenants often don’t move their personal belongings out of the home until the day they must return the keys. Know the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today “How does a professional cleaner handle walking into a ‘move-out clean’ or end-of-lease clean, and the client has not quite moved out?” the Melbourne cleaner said in a video. “Because this happens quite often... It always amazes me how many people leave everything to the very last day of a tenancy: removalist, cleaners, keys back and more. “That is the most stressful way to do it.” During one of her latest jobs, Stephens was hired to do a “bachelor pad” end-of-lease clean. “I think it wasn’t too bad, other than they hadn’t quite finished moving out,” she said, laughing. The video shows a kitchen with cookware on the stove, rubbish strewn over the benchtops and canned foods, condiments and staples left untouched in the walk-in pantry. Before a professional cleaner arrives to do the major task, tenants are expected to move everything out. The business owner of The Big Clean Co cleaning service has urged renters to give themselves at least one day between when the removalist comes and when the keys go back to the real estate agent or landlord. She says giving yourself time will allow you to prepare for any unexpected things and to ensure you have “done absolutely everything you need to do” before moving out. When a professional cleaner arrives at a property and it’s nowhere near ready for end-of-lease cleaning, Stephens says she usually offers the client three options. “One: Client pays more money immediately for the cleaner to take it all out of the house. “Two: The cleaner can start on another area while the client moves it themselves. “Three: The cleaner can push most of it to the side and go around it.” Stephens previously shared an end-of-lease cleaning guide to help tenants get their full bond back after moving out. “Moving out of a rental? Here are the top five things that property managers have hawk eyes for that you can complete before move out day. It’s drilled into our brains to not miss these things,” she said. One of the places renters always forget to deep clean are the window tracks. “Property managers are obsessed with window tracks,” she said. “The best way to clean window tracks is to vacuum the excess out (using a small attachment), then place a cloth over the end of a toothbrush to clean.” She has urged tenants to remove the hidden soap scum, mould or rust stains in the edges around the shower screen. Stephens says ovens are often neglected. “Use a toothbrush to get into the corners of the oven,” she explained, adding that ovens require a deep clean inside and out. The cleaner suggested you need to soak the “greasy” cook top knobs, if they come off, in soapy water — and ensure you thoroughly clean the area. Other places to clean include exhaust fans and ceiling fans, as they collect a lot of dust over time. Sign up to the 7NEWS app here - the news you want, when you need it.

Arsenal are hoping to make the first major breakthrough of the summer transfer window with a deal for a new striker. Reports in Portugal claim a deal for Sporting CP striker Viktor Gyokeres is close, so it’ll be interesting to see if that is backed up today. Victor Osimhen and Santiago Gimenez have also been touted as targets. Over at Chelsea , a swap deal is being pushed for Michael Olise which would see Trevoh Chalobah move to Crystal Palace. Fulham are also in the mix for Chalobah . The Blues are set to sell Ian Maatsen to Aston Villa and have also been linked with Argentine defender Aaron Anselmino and Jhon Duran. Tottenham remain in the hunt for Chelsea midfielder Conor Gallagher, now a target for Arsenal, with Ivan Toney and Ricardo Calafiori on their radar. Like Arsenal, Manchester United want a new striker with Jonathan David and Joshua Zirkzee their top priority. Follow all the latest transfer news, rumours and gossip live below! Latest transfer news and rumours Live updates Chelsea are formulating a swap deal to sign Michael Olise. Trevoh Chalobah, who Standard Sport reported yesterday is a target for Fulham, is said by GiveMeSport to be on offer to Crystal Palace. Olise was claimed recently to have agreed personal terms with Chelsea and has a release clause in the region of £60m. However, it is said to be complex and involve a sell-on fee direct to the player. Therefore, Palace may prefer to negotiate and Chelsea hope to make in-roads with Chalobah as a makeweight. Reports yesterday of a new contract proposal from the Eagles to Olise have also been dismissed. It has been claimed that Arsenal are in advanced talks to sign Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting CP. That’s according to Portuguese outlet Leonino as the Gunners look to land a new striker for next season. The Swede is said to have an £86m release clause so it’ll be interesting to learn more about this supposed deal. It’s safe to say that fans in Lisbon have brushed off this report as nothing substantial. Sporting, for their part, want Panathinaikos attacker Fotis Ioannidis as Gyokeres’ replacement. That’s a rumour that has been doing the rounds far and wide. Manchester United have been given a boost in their pursuit of Joshua Zirkzee. According to Italian journalist Nick Semeraro, the Bologna striker’s agent, Kia Joorabchian, has dropped his demands from £12.5m to £8m for United. AC Milan are still in the race, but must pay Joorabcian’s full rate. Zirkzee has a £34m release clause. Tottenham and Liverpool appear to be engaged in a transfer battle over Riccardo Calafiori. The Bologna defender is attracting rave reviews early in his career and already has three senior international caps for Italy, with some - including ex-England boss Fabio Capello - already dubbing him as the new Sergio Ramos. Italian publication Il Bianconero report that Spurs could jump ahead of Juventus in the queue by launching a bid for Calafiori, while Liverpool are also now being linked with the 22-year-old. Manchester United will end their interest in Jarrad Branthwaite if Everton are unwilling to negotiate. That's according to ESPN, who report that United are yet to increase their opening offer of £35m plus £8m add-ons - which was dismissed immediately by Everton. The Toffees are demanding at least £70m, which United will not pay. Fulham have revived their transfer interest in Chelsea defender Trevoh Chalobah, writes Dom Smith . The centre-back is one of several players who could leave Stamford Bridge this summer. Chalobah has four years left on his contract but, as an academy graduate, would count as pure profit in any sale as Chelsea bid to ensure that they stay in line with Premier League profit and sustainability rules. After missing the first six months of last season with a hamstring injury, Chalobah impressed at the end of the campaign and Fulham, who considered signing him last summer, have now renewed their interest. Read more here! Arsenal \\"very close\\" to sealing a deal for Sporting striker Viktor Gyokeres. That's according to Portuguese outfit Leonino, who claims Mikel Arteta has picked his preferred striker target and the club are now moving quickly to wrap up the signing. There is no word of a free, but the former Coventry striker has been touted at around £50-60m this summer after 43 goals and adding a futher 15 assists in 50 appearances for Sporting last season. More now on Chelsea’s apparent transfer interest in Aaron Anselmino. Reports from Argentina this week have claimed that the Blues lodged a £13.3m bid with Boca Juniors for their teenage defender. Fabrizio Romano now claims that Chelsea do indeed have “genuine interest” in Anselmo and are aware of what it will take to land his signature. He says there has been no offer yet, but a close eye is being kept on developments around the 19-year-old. Arsenal look to be battling Borussia Dortmund for the signing of Ferdi Kadioglu. The Gunners have previously been linked more than once with the versatile Turkey full-back, who plies his club trade with Fenerbahce. Dortmund are said to have made contact over a move for Kadioglu, though Ajan Sport in Turkey claim that Arsenal have tabled an offer of €20m. Manchester United look to have received a timely boost in their pursuit of Joshua Zirkzee. The Dutch international forward, a late injury call-up to the Netherlands squad for Euro 2024, is known to be high on the list of potential attacking reinforcements this summer at Old Trafford. However, United have faced plenty of rival interest in Zirkzee, including from the likes of Arsenal, Liverpool and AC Milan. But according to reports in Italy cited by Football Transfers, AC Milan are no longer considered as the front runners for Zirkzee and could now move for free agent Memphis Depay instead.

Around 70 per cent of CEOs are channeling investments into technology, including AI, to catalyse growth and enhance productivity over the next 12 months, which is much higher than their global counterpart at 47 per cent, according to the 'EY CEO Outlook Pulse Survey'. However, fortifying data management and cybersecurity (56 per cent) and pursuing cost optimisation across business facets (50 per cent) also stand out as critical strategic imperatives in the near term. Moreover, the acquisition of technology, new production capabilities, or innovative startups (44 per cent) emerges as the leading strategic driver for mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activities, said the report. \\"Commitment to tech investments is not just a response to the present but a strategic leap towards the future. The survey underscores this momentum, revealing that a substantial majority of CEOs are actively aligning their organisations with an AI-centric blueprint for innovation and productivity,\\" said Mahesh Makhija, EY India Technology Consulting Leader. Despite a majority of CEOs acknowledging the growing importance of sustainability compared to a year ago, there is a trend of sustainability slipping down the priority list for almost 16 per cent of CEOs, overshadowed by financial constraints and a shift in boardroom focus. To bolster the sustainability agenda, corporate India advocates for technology incentives, including AI, as well as subsidies and tax breaks for green technology investments, coupled with governmental backing of sustainable infrastructure projects.","pubDate":"2024-06-21 05:23:19","image_url":"https://st1.latestly.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Artificial-Intelligence-2-380x214.jpg","source_id":"latestly","source_priority":5523,"source_url":"https://www.latestly.com","source_icon":"https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/latestly.png","language":"english","country":"india","category":"technology","ai_tag":"artificial intelligence","ai_region":"india,asia","ai_org":null,"sentiment":"neutral","sentiment_stats":"positive:0.08,neutral:99.81,negative:0.11"},{"article_id":"5311b8f7cfe16849aeca497cacc7c7fb","title":"'Sweet Home' 2 teaser: Song Kang unleashes his fierce self for a thrilling battle in this apocalyptic horror","link":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/web-series/news/korean/sweet-home-2-latest-teaser-song-kang-unleashes-his-fierce-self-for-a-thrilling-battle-in-this-apocalyptic-horror/articleshow/111157180.cms","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The final season of 'Sweet Home' premieres on July 19, featuring Song Kang as Hyun Soo in a key role against formidable adversaries.

These changes aim to boost revenue for distribution companies (DISCOs), which currently see only 2% of their revenue from fixed charges, despite these charges accounting for 72% of the total electricity cost structure. The shift seeks to better align the revenue and cost structure of electricity distribution. The new tariffs mark a significant adjustment for all users, intending to balance the financial flow within the electricity sector.","pubDate":"2024-06-21 05:22:30","image_url":"https://enews.hamariweb.com/tpl_assets/2024/06/Untitled-Project-2024-06-21T102209.464.jpg","source_id":"hamariweb","source_priority":9251,"source_url":"https://enews.hamariweb.com","source_icon":"https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/hamariweb.jpg","language":"english","country":"pakistan","category":"top","ai_tag":"economy","ai_region":"pakistan,asia","ai_org":"nepra","sentiment":"positive","sentiment_stats":"positive:82.6,neutral:16.93,negative:0.47"},{"article_id":"290c4178a20a519db95186a73de66d3e","title":"Probe into ‘monster’ Ryan Geoffrey Cole continues as tributes flow for Mackay murder victim Natalie Frahm","link":"https://7news.com.au/news/probe-into-monster-ryan-geoffrey-cole-continues-as-tributes-flow-for-mackay-murder-victim-natalie-frahm-c-15096609","keywords":null,"creator":"Laine Clark and Warren Barnsley","video_url":null,"description":"‘She’s going to be sadly missed.’","content":"A shocked Queensland community has rallied around two girls after a woman was allegedly shot dead in front of them in her car by a neighbour. Tributes have poured in for Natalie Frahm after the 34-year-old was killed in the driveway of her Mackay home on Wednesday afternoon. Frahm was in the car preparing to leave for a sporting activity when she was allegedly shot by Ryan Geoffrey Cole, with the girls in the back seat. Know the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today Cole, 31, is also accused of shooting a good Samaritan after the girls — aged 11 and 12 — escaped the vehicle and raised the alarm. James McGill, 66, was visiting his elderly mother who lived nearby when he came to Frahm’s aid after the girls asked for help. He suffered hand and chest injuries after allegedly being shot by Cole, but is in a stable condition in hospital following surgery. Cole was a neighbour but did not know Frahm , police said, and a motive for the alleged attacks is yet to be established. “We’re working really hard to look into the background of Mr Cole ... To find out what his movements were prior to the incident and afterwards so we can establish what may have been a contributing factor,” Detective Acting Superintendent Emma Novosel said on Friday. “As you can imagine, this is a complex investigation. We’re going to be really methodical about how we go trying to determine what the cause was.” A revolver-style gun believed to have been allegedly used by Cole to murder Frahm has not been found, Novosel said. Nicholas Vanderzee, the owner of Mang Gon Thai Boxing and a friend of Frahm, said Frahm never mentioned her neighbour and alleged killer Cole. Vanderzee said Frahm was a dedicated and beloved member of the club who started in the sport almost two years ago when her son joined. “She used to come and drop him off and she would watch. She quite liked what she saw,” he told 7NEWS. “We encourage parents to jump in and start training. There’s nothing better than a parent training with heir children. “She started and absolutely fell in love with Muay Thai ... Loved the training, loved to get pushed, she what she was capable of doing.” Vanderzee said he was “lost for words” when he was told of Frahm’s “gut-wrenching” death. “She was a beautiful person. Absolutely beautiful person. She had the beautiful smile and was just such a pleasant being,” he said. “She’s going to be sadly missed.” The club also set up a GoFundMe fundraiser for the girls, with more than $9000 already pledged on Friday. Mackay Mayor Greg Williamson said the community is “reeling” at the “random, outrageous act of violence”. Frahm’s parents have flown in from Mount Isa, with floral tributes starting to arrive outside her South Mackay home. Support has been provided to the two girls as the South Mackay community also tries to process the incident. “The two young girls who were in the back of the car and ran off to get help are going to live with this for the rest of their lives,” Williamson said. “It’s going to be a grieving process which will take a fair while to work out ... but over the next few days the community will rally.” The mayor hailed the bravery of the girls as well as McGill who approached the alleged gunman after answering their calls for help. “How good was that? It’s a typical Australian reaction, I think — you go in and help,” he said. Cole is accused of shooting Frahm and McGill before driving away, sparking an emergency lockdown and police manhunt. He was later arrested at a nearby service station and was charged with murder and attempted murder on Thursday. Police are investigating how Cole allegedly gained access to a firearm after having a weapons licence revoked three years ago. “I don’t think there’s a single person in Queensland whose heart doesn’t break for Natalie and her family and friends,” Queensland Police Minister Mark Ryan said. “It’ll always be impossible to rationalise the decision-making of a monster. “This person had firearms illegally. His weapons licence had been cancelled. Police had taken those weapons off him. “Part of the investigation will look at how he might’ve come into possession of this illegal firearm ... but that work, we’ve got to allow police to do.” Cole was remanded in custody as his matter was mentioned in Mackay Magistrates Court on Friday, to be next heard in July.","pubDate":"2024-06-21 05:20:36","image_url":"https://images.7news.com.au/publication/C-15096609/17405f253cc4c6551802a205945ffcdd17b7e5b4-16x9-x0y0w2000h1125.jpg","source_id":"7news","source_priority":7652,"source_url":"https://7news.com.au","source_icon":"https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/7news.png","language":"english","country":"australia","category":"top","ai_tag":"accidents","ai_region":"queensland,maryland,united states of america,north america,mackay,queensland,australia,australia/oceania,queensland,australia,australia/oceania","ai_org":null,"sentiment":"neutral","sentiment_stats":"positive:2.24,neutral:97.25,negative:0.51"},{"article_id":"7c560d62946b20ac337aa71176222548","title":"How to watch Slovakia vs Ukraine for FREE: TV channel and live stream for Euro 2024 game today","link":"https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/how-to-watch-slovakia-vs-ukraine-free-tv-channel-live-stream-euro-2024-today-b1165440.html","keywords":"football,sport","creator":"Jonathan Gorrie","video_url":null,"description":"Falcons looking to make knockout rounds","content":"Sport | Football Slovakia can reach the knockout stages of Euro 2024 with a win over Ukraine later today.

Traffic lights stop, choking traffic, accompanied by the constant rumble of generators installed outside cafes and shops. Ukraine, including Kyiv, is struggling to cope with a new wave of rolling blackouts after took out half the country’s power generation capacity. Residents and businesses of Kyiv are adapting to the absence of electricity using generators, power banks, and flashlights and even recalculating their bathroom visits. Heavy damage inflicted to the country’s power system has left millions feeling uncertain about Ukraine’s ability to meet the national electricity demand after the warm weather months are over and the weather turns cold. “I light my apartment as our grandparents used to — with candles and small flashlights,” said Rudoy, a 40-year-old insurance agent from Israel who relocated from Tel Aviv to Kyiv in 2023 after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. He said that he wanted a new life despite the war — to live side-by-side with old friends and reside in a milder climate — but he hadn't foreseen the inconveniences of living without power. Rudoy bought an apartment on the seventh floor of a newly built 25-story high rise with no gas system or water supply that's wholly dependent on electricity. “I have to adjust my life to the blackout schedules, otherwise it is impossible to live normally — not even to use a toilet at times,” Rudoy told The Associated Press. A friend in a nearby district typically has power when he doesn’t, which makes his life easier. Work often gets done at a cafe that has a generator, but there’s a catch. “Even if you find a free table at a cafe nearby, working generators are very noisy and spread diesel fumes,\\" he said. \\"That’s why not many cafes that operate during blackouts are actually good to work in.” Ukraine is struggling to meet electricity demand as systematic attacks on its power infrastructure have intensified since March, forcing utilities to ration household supplies over the last three months. The country’s top officials repeatedly called on allied countries to provide more air defense systems to protect its power plants from Russian missiles and drones, but tangible damage had already been inflicted. The blackouts in Kyiv are the worse since the early months of the war when Russian strikes on the country’s power grid led to that led to authorities setting up communal heating areas and hundreds of emergency points where residents could drink tea, recharge their phones and get help. “As of today, due to missile and drone attacks, we have lost 9.2 gigawatt of electricity (generating capabilities),” Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said in early June. Despite having the capacity to import 2.2 gigawatts of electricity from European countries, Ukraine is importing 1.7 gigawatts, Shmyhal said. Apart from direct imports, Ukraine is working to attract foreign investment to its private energy sector. At a summit in Berlin this month, Ukraine presented investment projects that could enable additional capacity of 1 gigawatt, said Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, the head of power utility Ukrenergo. But in the short-term, Ukraine’s readiness before next winter looks highly uncertain considering the damages to its energy system, the feasible outlook for reconstruction, and electricity demand. Constant blackouts bring disruption to many city residents’ daily rituals. Official power outage schedules published regularly by Ukrainian energy operators make it easier to plan the day. But energy companies often resort to unscheduled emergency blackouts when the city overconsumes electricity at the peak hours. The circumstances force businesses and households to rely on alternative sources of electricity and light to get through a day as the summer heat makes more and more people use air conditioners. And many are worried the situation could get even worse. Small businesses don’t always keep up, with the energy situation rapidly changing every week. Oleksandr Solovei, the 25-year-old owner of Informatyka coffee shop in Kyiv, just plans to buy a generator, which typically costs around $1,000, to keep his business open during blackouts. In the meantime, he must improvise. “We prepare hot water in advance, to cook matcha and teas. Cooking coffee at times like this is impossible. The coffee machine consumes too much energy,” Solovei told the AP. A fiber-optic internet cable and a power bank that keeps the router on attract patrons to Informatyka, where they can work on their laptops. Still, customers have thinned out since the blackouts began. “We think the situation will get worse (by winter),” Solovei said. “We already plan to buy a generator, powerful enough to brew coffee, light the space, and charge the devices of our visitors. We are preparing for a hard winter.” ___ Follow the AP’s coverage of the war at","pubDate":"2024-06-21 05:19:52","image_url":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/4n9mTzvKPFPjJ_tz67hjWA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTY0MQ--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/daaecf473effe0738a1eec5f453ac221","source_id":"yahoo","source_priority":17,"source_url":"https://news.yahoo.com","source_icon":"https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/yahoo.png","language":"english","country":"united states of america","category":"top","ai_tag":"renewable energy,energy","ai_region":"kyiv,kyiv,ukraine,europe,russia,ohio,united states of america,north america,ukraine,europe,kyiv,ukraine,europe","ai_org":"ap","sentiment":"negative","sentiment_stats":"positive:0.23,neutral:1.5,negative:98.27"},{"article_id":"838b44d9ec2819f8209406c61390b6a6","title":"Why Uluru is the best winter getaway for couples: Aussies are flocking to the Northern Territory on Virgin flights","link":"https://7news.com.au/best-picks/why-uluru-is-the-best-winter-getaway-for-couples-aussies-are-flocking-to-the-northern-territory-on-virgin-flights-c-15095473","keywords":null,"creator":"Matilda Rudd","video_url":null,"description":"Beachside holidays are all but ruled out during the colder seasons but don’t deny yourself an inland escape.","content":"It’s no secret that my fiancé and I are huge fans of the beach, after all we live within a stone’s throw distance of Australia’s most famous stretch of sand — Bondi. So when it comes to spending time abroad or simply away from our local haunts we often still choose areas that are close to the coast where we can prioritise surfing, paddleboarding, camping and hiking, a view of the water always within sight. And while we’ve done a fairly good job over the years of ticking off Australia’s most prized spans of ocean, winter brings with it a new challenge of finding somewhere relaxing — but warm — to enjoy together. Know the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today So with Virgin Australia announcing new flight routes from Melbourne and Brisbane straight to Uluru, we decided to tick off a bucket list holiday destination as far away from the coast as possible — and we did it all in a long weekend. From Sydney we travelled through to Melbourne, which only takes an hour, and then almost immediately onto Uluru’s tiny desert airport , making the travel day to the Red Centre one of the shortest flights I’ve been on. Upon landing my partner shuffled straight up to the Hertz desk to pick up a mammoth Toyota Prado 4x4 which would then make getting around the town of Yulara and onto the Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park a breeze. I can’t recommend the team enough for swiftly organising our car rental but if you do decide to book in tours by themselves there is a free airport shuttle bus that will take you to your nearby hotel. We stayed at Sails in the Desert , a luxury five-star resort mere moments away from all of the action and with its own swimming pool, bars, eateries and enormous rooms. The best thing about booking through Voyages Ayers Rock Resort is that you can lock in your accommodation, dinners and tours all in the one place, so you can focus on relaxation and romance in the desert. I started with a 60-minute massage at the award-winning Red Ochre spa which is actually about a one minute walk from the outside of our room. It’s so easy to forget the little luxuries when life is on the go at home so taking the time to lay down and be pampered was a welcome addition to the trip. Once we had explored our room — TWO beds, a shower that could fit an entire family and a deck overlooking the pool — we got ready for our first night out at Arnguli Grill. This eatery is actually in the neighbouring hotel Desert Gardens but you can walk there from Sails in the Desert, which is just as well because you’re going to want to enjoy a bottle of wine together. Not only was the service extremely accommodating — my partner has a serious nut allergy — but the food was beyond delicious, with the steaks their speciality. We actually spoke to a young couple also enjoying their time at Arnguli who said it was one of the best restaurants they’d ever been to, so we weren’t the only ones heaping praise on it. And while our dinner was first class I’d be remiss for not mentioning just how scrumptious the following morning’s buffet breakfast was at Sails in the Desert. Whether you’re in the market for a traditional Full English, cereal, yoghurt, fruit, a salad, dumplings, pancakes or simply an egg omelette we were overwhelmed by the choices and had at least three servings a piece. While there is a supermarket in Yulara, the town with which the Ayers Rock Resort postings are situated, I can’t recommend dining in at the hotels enough — particularly if you’re preparing for a big day ahead. With the added benefit of having a hire car to zip around in, Charlie and I decided to do the Valley of the Winds walk at Kata Tjuta during our stay. Winter is the perfect time to go on a hike in the national park because the weather tops the mid-20s range, so you’ll never be sweating too profusely or requiring more than a few litres of water at a time. We also ended up walking around the base of Uluru itself, which took us about three hours to complete. Hiring a pushbike or segway while you’re there is also a good way to take in the enormity of what’s surrounding you but we found it equally as peaceful to walk hand in hand through the sand. When it came to choosing dinner on our second and final night there were options galore. To absolutely treat you and your partner, the Tali Wiru experience is like no other, with a four-hour degustation-style menu paired with Penfolds wines and stargazing on the agenda. But we opted for the Field of Light dinner so we could see the magic 50,000-strong light installation alongside a three-course bush tucker inspired buffet. You watch the sun set over Uluru with a glass of sparkling wine in hand before eating and drinking alongside a host of tourists and other Australians combined. When the sun completely sets you get the opportunity to explore the Field of Light up close — which is constantly being maintained and upheld because of its popularity — before a bus drops you back to the hotel. The Ayers Rock Resort is extremely family friendly — there were kids at the hotel and on many of the tours — but even they understand the importance of Uluru and its surrounds so that doesn’t hampen the romantic experience. While we may not have seen an ocean the gorges surrounding Uluru were enough of a water fix to make us second guess why we hadn’t travelled inland sooner.

That song is Malone’s sixth leader and Wallen’s second, and the first to collect at least its first five weeks on the chart at No. 1 since Miley Cyrus’ “Flowers” spent its first six weeks on the survey at the summit in January-March 2023. “I Had Some Help” is also the first smash to reign over the chart for five consecutive weeks in nearly a year. F-1 Trillion is slated for release Aug. 16, and is Posty’s sixth studio album, following 2023’s Austin . Two of those LPs have hit No. 1 on the Billboard 200. Malone’s genre-hopping activities of late have included a performance on the Academy of Country Music Awards in May, performing a song called “Never Love You Again;” a spot at the Stagecoach Festival 2024 in Indio, CA; and a performance earlier in the week at Nashville’s Bluebird Cafe, where he was joined by Lainey Wilson, Ernest, and multi-hit songwriter Ashley Gorley for an industry-only writers’ round at the famed songwriters venue.

William, president of the FA, was pictured alongside Denmark’s King Frederick as the two teams went head to head in Frankfurt , Germany , with the Three Lions drawing 1-1 in their second match of the tournament. William has faced a challenging 12 months with both his wife the Princess of Wales and father the King diagnosed with cancer. His birthday came amid speculation the future king supports his father’s slimmed-down approach to the monarchy and that William may not want his younger children Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis to be working royals. The Daily Mail’s Richard Eden wrote that a friend of the prince told him: “When the older members of the family retire, His Royal Highness won’t be inviting anyone else to become working royals. “It remains to be seen if he will even want his two younger children to be working royals.” Ten-year-old Prince George is a future king, but third in line Charlotte, aged nine, and fourth in line Louis, six, are spares to the heir and, therefore, not expected to ever reign as monarch. Kate returned briefly to the public limelight at Trooping the Colour last weekend with William and their three children. But in a personal message to the nation, the princess revealed although she is making good progress, she is “not out of the woods yet”. Kate told how she has good days and bad days and is facing a few more months of chemotherapy treatment. How to watch England vs South Africa: TV channel and live stream Give people reason for hope rather than alarm on social care, say sector leaders GPs ‘struggle to find work as patients left in pain’ – union Share your cat or dog's joyful moment to win William was seen with his mother-in-law Carole Middleton this week on a day out at Royal Ascot , where he took to a carriage with his stepmother the Queen for the traditional procession along the course. Prince William Arthur Philip Louis of Wales was born second in line to the throne at St Mary’s Hospital, Paddington, at 9.03pm on June 21 1982. He weighed 7lb 1 1/2oz and was the first-born son of the then-Prince and the Princess of Wales. At just nine months old, he accompanied his parents on a six-week official visit to Australia and New Zealand, which was a break from tradition with royal babies usually left at home in the care of nannies. His mother Diana , who separated from the then-Prince of Wales in 1992, died in a car crash in Paris in 1997. William was just 15 and his brother Prince Harry 12, and the boys walked behind the princess’s coffin during a funeral procession through London. The prince met Kate Middleton at St Andrews University in Fife, and the pair married at Westminster Abbey in 2011 after dating for more than eight years. They welcomed their first child George in 2013, followed by Charlotte in 2015, and then Louis in 2018. After the death of the late Queen in 2022, the King announced in his first historic address that he had made William and Kate the new Prince and Princess of Wales. William has a long-running rift with his brother the Duke of Sussex, with no sign yet of a reconciliation. The fallout originated ahead of Harry’s wedding to Meghan Markle, now the Duchess of Sussex, and worsened after the accusations Harry publicly levelled at his brother in his double tell-alls: his Netflix documentary and his memoir Spare. When their joint friend the Duke of Westminster married in Chester Cathedral earlier this month, William acted as an usher, but Harry mutually agreed with the groom that he would not attend. Since his last birthday, William has launched Homewards, his five-year drive to eradicate homelessness in six locations around the UK. His other key focuses include raising mental health awareness, and the Earthshot Prize, his £50 million environmental competition to find solutions to help the planet.

In a short clip shared to his social media accounts on Thursday, the 69-year-old actor and filmmaker made it official that he would not be returning for an appearance on the hit Western crime series when it returns for season 5B. 'Hi everyone. I just want to reach out and let you know that after this long year and a half of working on Horizon and doing all the things that's required, and thinking about Yellowstone — that beloved series that I love, that I know you love — I just realized that I'm not going to be able to continue Season 5b or into the future,' Costner announced somberly while gazing into the camera. Previous reports indicated that Costner was likely done for good with the series after conflicts between himself and producers over pay, his schedule and his availability to film his multi-part Western epic Horizon. But fans held out hope that he might at least return to find a dignified ending for his patriarch John Dutton, but his new video has seemingly dashed those hopes for good.

Addressing the Parliament, Arya pointed out that the ideology behind this terrorist attack continues to exist among a small number of people in Canada . He urged everyone to attend memorial services on June 23, marking the 39th anniversary of the 1985 Kanishka flight bombing carried out by Khalistani separatists. Arya's comments come after Canada's parliament marked the first death anniversary of designated Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar by holding a moment of silence in the House of Commons. During his address, Arya stated, \\"Mr Speaker, June 23rd is the National Day of Remembrance for Victims of Terrorism. 39 years back, on this day, Air India Flight 182 was blown up mid-day by a bomb planted by Canadian Khalistani extremists. It killed all 329 passengers and crew members and is the largest mass killing in Canadian history.\\" The MP voiced his concern regarding the recent glorification of the assassination of former Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by Khalistani supporters. \\"Recent celebration of the assassination of Hindu Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by Khalistan supporters, glorifying violence and hate, shows that the dark forces have been energized again and point to dreadful times ahead. Hindu-Canadians are rightfully concerned. I stand in solidarity with the families of the victims of Air India bombing,\\" Arya said in Parliament. The Montreal-New Delhi Air India 'Kanishka' Flight 182 exploded 45 minutes before it was scheduled to land at London's Heathrow Airport on June 23, 1985, killing all 329 people on board, most of them Canadians of Indian descent. The bombing was blamed on Sikh militants in retaliation to 'Operation Bluestar'. The memorial service organized by India takes place amidst strained relations between New Delhi and Canada over the issue of Khalistani terrorists, following Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's allegation in September last year of the \\"potential\\" involvement of Indian agents in the killing of Nijjar.","pubDate":"2024-06-21 05:17:25","image_url":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111156952,imgsize-594347,width-400,resizemode-4/111156952.jpg","source_id":"toi","source_priority":391,"source_url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com","source_icon":"https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/toi.png","language":"english","country":"india","category":"top","ai_tag":null,"ai_region":"canada,kentucky,united states of america,north america","ai_org":"parliament","sentiment":"negative","sentiment_stats":"positive:0.17,neutral:1.6,negative:98.24"},{"article_id":"86d2e85b944f5469e307c76ca13a6eeb","title":"Corner shops are cool again: 10 new delis with a difference in Melbourne","link":"https://www.smh.com.au/goodfood/melbourne-eating-out/corner-shops-are-cool-again-10-new-delis-with-a-difference-in-melbourne-20240607-p5jk3r.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_feed","keywords":"food / eating out (mel)","creator":"Emma Breheny","video_url":null,"description":"From empanadas and mock meats to bulk soy sauce and beer on tap: what don’t Melbourne’s new-wave delis and grocers do?","content":"From empanadas and mock meats to bulk soy sauce and beer on tap: what don’t Melbourne’s new-wave delis and grocers sell?

Save this article for later Add articles to your saved list and come back to them anytime. Thinking small is the biggest trend in food shopping right now. Small-batch curry paste. Small eco-footprint toilet roll. And, most noticeably, small and independent grocers where staff will pack your items, choose what goes on the shelves, and probably even make your toasted sandwich. The corner shop is reinventing itself for a contemporary crowd. “We’re putting the petrol in the car again,” says Mark Fine, referring to the way petrol station attendants used to fill up customers’ cars. The former sports broadcaster has revamped Caulfield North institution Lenny’s with wife Natalie, bringing the 25-year-old Jewish deli into the “designer deli” era. “It really is a feast for eyes and that’s what a deli is these days,” he says. But the Fines have held on to a few old ideas that are finding new currency: exceptional customer service, hands-on owners, and home-style cooking. At Stanley Street Bodega in Collingwood, great coffee meets convenience store in a densely populated pocket of the suburb. “Asian convenience stores just fascinate me ... I can spend a long time in there,” says owner Eddie Inostroza. Believing that “every country’s got its own style of convenience store”, he’s created his own interpretation, combining his career running cafes, his Chilean heritage, and the things nearby apartment-dwellers seek out, such as wine and fancy potato chips. Of course, Melbourne’s never been short of top-of-the-range food shops. A1 Bakery on Sydney Road is legendary, there are Euro delis galore at our markets, and dotting the suburbs are beacons such as Richmond’s Greek stalwart Laikon , Malvern butcher-deli Lewis & Son and, until recently, Italian specialist Enoteca Sileno . The next generation is picking up these ideas and running with them, adding even more niche specialty items and high-quality food to eat there or nearby. Lenny’s Fine Foods The blintzes, chicken soup and gefilte fish are still there. But the revamped Lenny’s – a neighbourhood institution for more than 20 years – packs in much more than your average Jewish deli. There’s even a vegan version of its famous chicken soup. Come for ready-to-heat dinners such as green curry or lamb shank and barley soup, or a takeaway bagel bursting with beef brisket, made by co-owner Mark Fine. Brightly painted timber walls inlaid with backlit signage steer you towards smoked and cured fish (including 12 kinds of herring), treats such as Basque cheesecake, golden schnitzels and American deli faves such as wedge salad. 636 Inkerman Road, Caulfield North, instagram.com/lennys_fine_food Stanley Street Bodega In love with the high-quality convenience stores of Asia and the bodegas of New York, owner Eddie Inostroza created his own version in the thick of Collingwood’s forest of apartments. The retail edit is small but smart. Canned tomatoes, eggs and St David’s Dairy yoghurt will get you out of tight spots, plus there’s fun stuff like Chappy’s chips and fancy peanut butter. Toasties and pastries are the main fare but there are also chicken and chorizo empanadas from Chilean food shop Two Chiles in Windsor. All about community, it’s open later than many cafes (hello, 5pm espresso and beer on tap) and is also extremely dog-friendly. R1, 72 Stanley Street, Collingwood, stanleystreetbodega.com Ima Pantry This is the corner shop many neighbourhoods would kill for. From the same owners as hit Japanese cafe Ima Asa/Yoru , this is a treasure trove of artisan soy sauce, yuzu kosho , Melbourne-made curry pastes, potato chips and kimchi, vegetables (all in season of course) and just about anything else you might need, including toilet roll. Toasties, croissants and onigiri (rice balls) are convenient for breakfast or lunch, or there’s a daily menu of okazu, side dishes to be eaten with rice. Customers are encouraged to bring their own bowls to reduce waste. 9 Duckett Street, Brunswick, imaproject.co Blakeaway Going from catering events to catering your day, Blakeaway (the offspring of Blake’s Feast caterers) has added two grocers to its growing empire. The South Yarra store sells everything from fancy crisps and designer homewares to tonight’s dinner: perhaps a wholesome chicken soup or a hulking lamb shoulder that’ll also do lunch tomorrow. In the city, office workers can sit down with their lasagne or grab a croque monsieur made on Bread Club sourdough to go. Before heading home, they might come back to grab dinner for one, vacuum-packed and ready to heat. 4 Avoca Street, South Yarra; 90 Flinders Lane, Melbourne, blakeaway.com.au Ripe and Cured All-Australian cheese shop Ripe has expanded its footprint at Queen Victoria Market, creating room to offer all things great and cured – from roo salami to rosy pancetta – alongside its impressive line-up of local cheese. Wheels are made by Section 28, Long Paddock, The Peaks, Bruny Island Cheese and more, and helpful staff guide you towards your perfect match. Killer cheese toasties are available (made with the stuff in the cabinet), with pastrami sangas and porchetta rolls joining the party on weekdays. Shop 61-65, Dairy Hall, Queen Victoria Market, Queen Street, Melbourne, ripecheese.com.au Grana Why wait until you get home to tear into those pretty pink rounds of culatello (cured ham)? Or open that bottle of swaggering Jura savagnin? Perch at the central tiled counter of this deli-wine bar from the Tipo 00 crew and do a little quality control. Every surface is crammed with preserves, salumi, crackers, amari and wines of the world. Aussie and European cheeses come with confident tasting notes, and there’s even their in-house line, Whitlow’s Wheels, made by chef Lucy Whitlow . More substantial snacking includes marinated octopus, pizza from Figlia next door and a sweet tart that changes daily. True retail therapy. 331 Lygon Street, Brunswick East, granadeli.com Ruben’s Deli The tiled floors scream Parisian kitchen but the bountiful refrigerated cabinets are a worldly mix of trout gravlax, miso-roasted brussels sprouts, slow-cooked lamb shoulder, house-smoked pastrami and more. Truly a one-stop shop, Ruben’s helps shoppers rustle up easy midweek dinners, spreads for parties when a few corners must be cut, and the week’s essentials (including butter and milk). While you’re there, pick up a hulking sanga such as a tuna melt, chicken schnitzel amped up with pickled jalapeno or the obvious choice, a reuben on marbled rye bread. Kings Arcade, 978 High Street, Armadale, rubensdeli.com Mortadeli Sandwiches? Check. Coffee? Check. Pasta bar ? Also check. And then there’s the namesake deli (or alimentari, as they call it) of this unstoppable Surf Coast business . Occupying two shopfronts in a small piazza, it’s the place to visit when you want to fill the car boot with mortadella, pates and terrines, eastern European smallgoods such as kabana and kranskies, a dizzying array of dried pasta plus the fresh stuff they make for the restaurant. Pick up From Scratch Dough pizza bases, then go wild with toppings back at your beach house. Or grab a coffee or a cannoli (piped to order) while you wait for your roast porchetta sanga from the takeaway diner. Shops 8 & 9, 4-6 Gilbert Street, Torquay, mortadeli.com.au Smith and Deli I can’t believe it’s not burrata. Or chicken. Or egg. These thoughts are common among customers visiting this light-filled space, which stocks everything any self-respecting European deli would, except it’s all plant-based. The deli showcases chef Shannon Martinez ’s skill in replicating buttery pastries, deli meats, cheese and the other joys of life, and also has a menu to rival any Melbourne cafe. Ponder sandwiches toasted, fresh or breakfast-appropriate; four or five daily salads; puffy glazed doughnuts; and hot dishes including a pie floater. Add comforting frozen meals such as chorizo pasta bake to your shopping basket. 107 Cambridge Street, Collingwood, smithanddeli.com Wild Life Superette You may already know Wild Life the bakery , creator of 10/10 cookies, sourdough, and kimchi and cheese croissants. Meet its sidekick, named after France’s convenience stores, where you can get all those baked goods and fill your pantry with a peck of pickles, jams, hot sauces and tinned things. It stocks cheese from leading local and global producers, top-shelf teas and coffee beans, gifts such as cookbooks, and much more. It’s a danger zone for your wallet – but very exciting for your tastebuds. 365 Sydney Road, Brunswick, wildlifebakery.com Restaurant reviews, news and the hottest openings served to your inbox.

Indeed, shoppers would be staggered to know that prices of various items have spiked significantly. Travel down the food aisle and you'll find that price tags for individual goods and services are far higher than they were three years ago, before inflation saw food prices jump by at least a quarter. Among the Office for National Statistics list of price rises, Olive oil has seen a staggering increase, rising by 39.1 per cent. Meanwhile sugar has risen seven per cent, vegetables 2.5 per cent, eggs 2.5 per cent, fruit 2.6 per cent and ready-made meals 3.8 per cent. Take a detour to beverage section and you'll see cocoa and powdered chocolate price is up 19.5 per cent. While juices from fruits and vegetables show an increase of 1.6 per cent, mineral or spring waters see a surge of 4.5 per cent, reports . Tea bags too aren't spared, recording a massive 9.8 per cent surplus cost while soft drinks have recorded 3.4 per cent rise. As for the booze lovers, beer has risen by 5.6 per cent, wine by 6.2 per cent and spirits by 5.7 per cent. Not all news initiates a panicked dash to the supermarket. As it turns out, The Office of National Statistics (ONS) announced that inflation has slid to its lowest since July 2021. This implies that while prices continue to rise, the pace is slower. The biggest \\"downward trend\\" was reported in the food sector with prices of food and non-alcoholic drinks rising by just 1.7 per cent in the year to May, a decrease from 2.9 per cent in April. This drop in pace is the lowest recorded from October 2021 and is a significant ease from the staggering 14-month peak of 19.2 per cent in March last year, which was the highest annual rate recorded for more than 45 years. The ONS has verified that the annual rates of inflation have eased off for nine of the 11 food and non-alcoholic beverage categories within the period of 12 months to May 2024. According to the figures released on Wednesday (June 19), the ONS stated that prices actually saw a decrease between April 2024 and May 2024, in contrast to the monthly increase observed the previous year.","pubDate":"2024-06-21 05:16:06","image_url":"https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/news/uk-news/article33076933.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/0_oliveoil.jpg","source_id":"dailystar","source_priority":3076,"source_url":"https://www.dailystar.co.uk","source_icon":null,"language":"english","country":"united kingdom","category":"top","ai_tag":"fmcg,economy","ai_region":null,"ai_org":"the office for national statistics","sentiment":"negative","sentiment_stats":"positive:0.36,neutral:3.91,negative:95.74"},{"article_id":"a9542d31ee1bfa5ea717e2a7cce2974d","title":"WATCH | Suryakumar Yadav-Rashid Khan's engage in playful banter during India vs Afghanistan clash; ‘stop sweeping me’","link":"https://www.livemint.com/sports/cricket-news/watch-suryakumar-yadav-rashid-khans-playful-banter-during-india-vs-afghanistan-t20-world-cup-clash-stop-sweeping-me-11718937550617.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"In the T20 World Cup 2024, Team India triumphed over Afghanistan, led by stellar batting displays from Suryakumar Yadav and Hardik Pandya, along with Jasprit Bumrah's bowling prowess.

Suryakumar Yadav and Hardik Pandya turned out to be the star performers with the bat for India while Jasprit Bumrah once again showed his class with the ball. Apart from the result of the match, another incident that is grabbing a lot of attention is the playful exchange between Afghan captain Rashid Khan and Surya Kumar Yadav. Notably, Rashid had caused considerable trouble to the Indian batters as he took the crucial wickets of Virat Kohli and Rishabh Pant while also restricting the flow of runs. However, when SKY, as he is popularly known amongst his fans, he brought on the sweep shot to tackle the threat posed by Rashid. In fact, Surya's sweeps seemed to have rattled Rashid so much that he went in to have a chat with the Indian batter. In a video shared on the official ICC handle, Surya can be seeing sweeping some deliveriess from Rashid for boundaries and sixes. And when the video does cut to the discussion between Rashid and Surya, the Afghani spinner can be seen with a smile on his face while SKY seems to be trying to explain something. At the end, Rashid playfully touched SKY's helmet before moving away from the discussion. Former India coach Ravi Shastri, who was in the commentator's box then divulged what Rashid and SKY may be talking about. With the camera facing Rashid, Shastri stated Afghanistan skipper told SKY “Stop sweeping me\\". Shastri then commenting on Surya's reponse to that discussion stated, “It's not my fault!\\" Rashid Khan is ‘best bowler’ in the world: While the duo may have engaged in a bit of playful banter on-ground, the mutual respect between them still seems to be intact. In fact, speaking after the match, Surya proclaimed Rashid Khan was the best bowler in the world. He said, \\"When he [Rashid] bowls, it's very difficult to pick him.

The unanswered questions in search for missing Brit teen - as hunt enters day five By Nick Pisa In Tenerife Published: 01:40 BST, 21 June 2024 | Updated: 06:13 BST, 21 June 2024 e-mail 20 shares View comments Mystery still surrounds the disappearance of British teenager Jay Slater who vanished after leaving a rave after party five days ago on the holiday island of Tenerife. Police using a helicopter, sniffer dogs and a drone, as well as mountain rescue units have been scouring countryside close to an AirBnB he went to with two British men. The isolated farmhouse was an hour's drive from the popular hotspot of Playa des Los Americas in southern Tenerife, in the village of Masca, 19 miles away. MailOnline has pieced together the last few hours before he disappeared and has tried to answer a series of puzzling questions that have left police and his family stumped. The first and most troubling is just where has the apprentice bricklayer from Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire got to. Jay Slater, 19, (pictured) was last heard from at 8.50am on Monday when he messaged his friend Lucy Mae Law to say he was lost and trying to make his way home Apprentice bricklayer Jay was last heard from at 8.50am on Monday Police officers and a sniffer dog are pictured in the search for Jay on June 19 A MailOnline graphic showing Jay's whereabouts hours before he went missing He arrived in Tenerife on June 12 with two friends – one named Brad and another Lucy Mae Law, who was the last person in contact with Jay before he vanished. Timeline of Jay Slater's disappearance June 12 - Jay arrived in Tenerife last Wednesday with his friend for the NRG rave a three day festival from 14-16 June at Los Cristianos. June 17 - In the early hours of Monday morning Jay is pictured at the after party at Xanadu enjoying himself with pals including Lucy Mae West. 2am - Lucy decides to leave and head back to her apartment but Jay remains at the party and gets chatting to two British men he has met. 5am - Jay and the two men leave and make an hour car journey along the tortuously twisty mountain road to the Air B and B at Masca where the two mystery British men are staying. 6am - Neighbours at Casa Abuela Tina report noises from the house. 7:30am - Jay sends a picture of the view from Casa Abuela Tina and a picture of him holding a cigarette on the stone doorstep of the house. Around 8am - Jay is seen by a local woman and he asks her how to get back to Los Cristianos by bus. She tells him the next one is not until 10am. 8.15am - The same woman says she saw him walking up the mountain and the wrong way 8.50am - Jay calls Lucy to say he has one percent on his phone and he is lost and has no idea where he is and he is trying to walk back Los Cristianos. A short while later his phone pings from a location close to the Mirador La Cruz De Hilda restaurant which overlooks a vast canyon and which is being searched by police. Advertisement The group had arrived for the NRG three-day festival that kicked off last Friday and ended with an afterparty into the early hours at Papagayo, on the notorious Playa des Los Americas strip. Jay, Brad and Lucy joined hundreds of other party goers for the rave which was billed as a 'weekend of electrifying music, stunning visuals, and innovative productions.' Video taken from the party shows Jay smiling and dancing and it was here that Lucy and Brad saw him for the last time, with both leaving at around 2am while he stayed on with two British men he had met. It's known that at around 4am just as the party was wrapping up police were called to Veronica's Strip to deal with 'an incident' but there is no suggestion Jay was involved in what happened. He is then known to have left with the two men at just before 5am and headed back to their rented AirBnB called Casa Abuele Tina, a journey along a twisting and turning mountain road. Lucy told MailOnline Jay had told her he was going with them and she urged him to 'get back' to their room at the Paloma Beach hotel but he refused and insisted he was going off with them. Lucy said:' I just don't understand why he went to their place, he'd only just met them and didn't know them at all. Brad and I said to come back but he didn't, if he had this wouldn't have happened.' Just who were these two men ? Little is known about them but they were described by Lucy as 'black and British' and MailOnline has spoken to the owner of a bar next door to the property who said she heard people in the house at 6am. While here at 7.30am Jay sent two Snapchat pictures to Lucy and his mother showing the view from the house onto the nearby valley and one of him holding a cigarette on the doorstep of the house. Half an hour another witness traced by MailOnline, Ofelia Medina Hernandez, said she had seen Jay standing by the bus stop directly outside the AirBnB and had asked about buses back to Los Cristianos. Ms Medina Hernandez explained that the next bus down the mountain in the Parque Rural de Teno was not until two hours later at 10am. She said: 'I held up my fingers on my hands to say 10am as he didn't understand me then I went home briefly before driving up the mountain to Buenavista del Norte, but this time I saw him walking on the road out of the village. 'It was no more than ten or fifteen minutes after I had spoken to him and he was about a kilometre from the house. I drove past him and that's the last I saw him.' New footage of the missing teen has show him partying at a rave in Tenerife just hours before he disappeared Jay is pictured right alongside mother Debbie. It is now the fifth day since he disappeared Museo - the last known location of 19-year-old Jay Slater who went missing four days ago The mountain range in Rural de Teno near the village of Masca where police are searching Police searched the hotel apartments Paloma Beach where Jay was staying in Los Christianos Lucy told MailOnline that the last message she had from him was at 8.50am when he told her he was 'lost, needed water and had 1 per cent battery' on his mobile and that he was going to try and walk 11 hours back with no trace of him since. But using the images he had sent her Lucy was able to track down the house where he had been staying with three hours after his last message and spoke to the men who were there. She said:' They seemed startled and surprised that I had found them, and I asked them where Jay was. Read More New footage shows missing Jay Slater partying at a rave in Tenerife just hours before he disappeared 'They said he had gone out to try and look for cigarettes and then come back and said he was leaving to try and get a bus back into town. 'They just seemed shocked that I had managed to find them and I know the police have spoken to them but I've since found out they have left the country. They need to be spoken to properly.' Lucy added: 'What I don't understand is if he did walk down then why wasn't he seen by anyone? It's a busy time of day, the place is full of hikers and holidaymakers, he could have asked them for help or stopped somewhere but no one has seen him at all.' The house – in the Parque Rural de Teno – was rented out by the two men from Friday to Monday but they stayed on a extra day after being questioned by police following Jay's disappearance. Locals have told MailOnline one of the men is known as 'Johnny Vegas' and Spanish police confirmed they had the names and passport details of both and sources say they posted a Snapchat image of themselves back at Gatwick. Frantic mother Debbie arrived on Tenerife on Tuesday after being woken by Lancashire police at home to tell her jay was missing and she should 'head out there' to try and help find him. At 7am she flew from Manchester to Tenerife with son Zak and shortly after she arrived was sent a menacing message on Snapchat that read: 'Kiss goodbye to your boy, you're never going to see him again, he owes me a lot of money.' Jay was reported missing on June 17 after he failed to return to the apartment he was sharing with friends in Tenerife, Spain following a night out and he has not been seen since Police officers and firefighters talk while searching for the missing 19-year-old The search for missing teenager Jay is now entering a fifth day after officers searched a ravine Police officers search in the Masca ravine for Jay on June 19. There has been no sign of him Debbie has passed the message to police and although she is convinced he is being held 'against his will' police say they are 'keeping an 'open mind' and have 'not ruled anything out or in'. It's not known who sent Debbie these messages and it begs the question that Debbie is asking – was he kidnapped and is he being held to ransom? Did he walk the wrong way because he was trying to get away from someone ? MailOnline has been told the last signal from Jay's phone and Mirador la Cruz de Hilda restaurant which has dramatic views over the Masca canyon and is criss crossed by trails that have nerve-jangling drops. Friends of Jay's have trawled the area for hours and although daytime temperatures are not to excessive at around 27c at night the thermometer plummets to just above zero due to the high altitude. MailOnline can also identify the owner of the AirBnB as former mayor of the nearby town of El Tanque, Roman Antonio Martin Canaves. But all attempts to contact him have been met with silence, messages are not returned and calls unanswered although there is no suggestion he has done anything untoward although the property is now listed as 'unavailable'. What is known about him is that in 2020 he was disqualified from public office for a year after being convicted of 'prevarication' in relation to the running of an elderly day care centre. But for the moment thoughts go out for Debbie, who has been left frantic with worry as any mother would be and who told the MailOnline she 'just wants my little baby boy back' and who should have welcomed him home but instead is worried sick for him.

His comments come after Seoul said it was considering such a possibility, in response to Russia and North Korea's new pact to help each other in the event of \\"aggression\\" against either country . Moscow \\"will... [make] decisions which are unlikely to please the current leadership of South Korea\\" if Seoul decides to supply arms to Kyiv, Mr Putin told reporters on Thursday. The Russian leader was speaking in Vietnam, shortly after a lavish visit to Pyongyang where he signed a mutual defence agreement with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Seoul had earlier condemned the agreement as a threat to its national security, and national security adviser Chang Ho-jin said his country planned to \\"reconsider the issue of arms support to Ukraine\\". Following Mr Putin's remarks, South Korea's presidential office said on Friday it would consider \\"various options\\" in supplying arms to Ukraine and its stance will \\"depend on how Russia approaches this issue\\". Authorities are also expected to summon Russia's ambassador to South Korea to lodge a protest, Yonhap news agency reported citing unnamed diplomatic sources. While South Korea has given humanitarian aid and military equipment to Ukraine, it has so far refused to provide lethal weapons as it has an official policy not to arm countries at war. Some in Ukraine have been hoping that the deepening military collaboration between Moscow and Pyongyang would cause Seoul to rethink its approach. Analysts had earlier said that Kyiv would use Mr Putin's visit to Pyongyang to up the pressure. During the visit, Mr Kim had also pledged \\"full support\\" for Russia's invasion of Ukraine. There is growing evidence that Russia has already been deploying North Korean missiles in Ukraine . Early on Friday the US national security council's spokesman John Kirby weighed in on the Russian-North Korean agreement, saying it should \\"be of concern to any country that cares about maintaining peace and stability\\" in the region. He added that the agreement was \\"no surprise\\", saying that the US had been warning about the two countries' \\"burgeoning defence relationship\\" for many months. Tokyo said it was “seriously concerned that President Putin did not rule out military technology co-operation with North Korea”, Japan's government spokesman Yoshimasa Hayashi said, adding that the agreement was \\"unacceptable\\". Analysts have said that the treaty could have significant implications for the world as well as the region. Besides the possibility of North Korean openly arming Russia, it could also potentially see Russia intervening in any fresh conflict on the Korean peninsula. The two Koreas are still technically at war and maintain a heavily guarded border, where tensions have worsened in recent weeks. In a separate incident on Thursday, North Korean troops \\"briefly crossed\\" the border and retreated after the South fired warning shots, Seoul authorities said on Friday. This marks the third such incident in less than three weeks. South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff had said the two earlier cases - on 9 June and 18 June - appeared to be unintentional .

Brady, widely considered the greatest quarterback in NFL history, is yet to enjoy a serious relationship since he and Brazilian model Gisele went their separate ways in 2022 after 13 years of marriage. However, in recent weeks rumors have been circulating online of a potential romance with glamorous online personality Isabella Settanni. US Weekly reports that Brady and Settani - who has 213,000 followers on Instagram - have been spotted together in public on multiple occasions of late. Yet according to an insider close to the situation, those rumors do not hold any weight. Tom Brady has been linked to a Brazilian influencer who looks just like his ex Gisele Bundchen Brady is yet to enjoy a serious relationship since he and Gisele went their separate ways READ MORE Tom Brady shares rare details of Bill Belichick's meticulous game day prep with Patriots It is believed Brady is not dating Settani despite the online gossip currently surrounding his love life. Dailymail.com has reached out to the New England Patriots legend's representatives for comment. His only fling since his split from Gisele was with model Irina Shayk, before the pair called off their brief romance in late 2023. Settani has been drawing comparisons to Gisele amid talk of a potential relationship with Brady, who was inducted into the Patriots' Hall of Fame last week. At the ceremony to induct him was iconic former head coach Bill Belichick, whose love life has also made headlines of late. Reports emerged last week that Belichick, 72, is currently dating 24-year-old cheerleader Jordon Hudson after meeting on a flight from Boston to Florida in 2021. Belichick and Hudson are said to have bonded over a philosophy project that Hudson - a student-athlete as well as an entrepreneur - had been working on at the time. Rumors have been circulating of a potential romance with Isabella Settanni (pictured) But it is believed the NFL legend is not dating Settanni, with the talk nothing more than rumors Brady's former coach Bill Belichick, 72, has been in the headlines of late for dating 24-year-old Jordon Hudson (left) They reportedly exchanged contact information after landing and kept in contact over the next few months while discussing the former Bridgewater State University student's school work and cheerleading routines. They initially kept things lowkey and were only briefly spotted on rare occasions, but TMZ claims Hudson secretly visited Gillette Stadium to support her man during the 2022 and 2023 seasons with the Patriots. It is believed they have been romantic for some time and are now considered an 'item' after taking their relationship to the next level. On Thursday, Dailymail.com exclusively captured Belichick and Hudson on a swanky dinner date in Nantucket.

What comes after, parents everywhere can attest, begins with some variation of: “Everyone has one. Why can’t I?”","content":"BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Try saying “no” when a child asks for a smartphone. What comes after, parents everywhere can attest, begins with some variation of: “Everyone has one. Why can’t I?” But what if no pre-teen in sight has one — and what if having a smartphone was weird? That’s the endgame of an increasing number of parents across Europe who are concerned by evidence that smartphone use among young kids — and share the conviction that there’s strength in numbers. From Spain to Britain and Ireland, parents are flooding WhatsApp and Telegram groups with plans not just to keep smartphones out of schools, but to link arms and refuse to buy young kids the devices before — or even into — their teenage years. After being inspired by a conversation in a Barcelona park with other moms, Elisabet García Permanyer started a chat group last fall to share information on the perils of Internet access for children with families at her kids’ school. The group, called “Adolescence Free of Mobile Phones,” quickly expanded to other schools and then across the entire country to now include over 10,000 members. The most engaged parents have formed pairs of activists in schools across Spain and are pushing for fellow parents to agree not to get their kids smartphones until they are 16. After organizing online, they facilitate real-world talks among concerned parents to further their crusade. “When I started this, I just hoped I would find four other families who thought like me, but it took off and kept growing, growing and growing,” García Permanyer says. “My goal was to try to join forces with other parents so we could push back the point when smartphones arrive. I said, ‘I am going to try so that my kids are not the only ones who don’t have one.’” A push, with the help of Spain’s government It isn’t just parents. Police and public health experts were sounding the alarm about a spike of violent and pornographic videos being witnessed by children via handheld devices. Spain’s government took note of the momentum and banned smartphones entirely from elementary schools in January. Now they can only be turned on in high school, which starts at age 12, if a teacher deems it necessary for an educational activity. “If we adults are addicted to smartphones, how can we give one to a 12-year-old who doesn’t have the ability to handle it?” García Permanyer asks. “This has gotten away from us. If the Internet were a safe space for children, then it would be fine. But it isn’t.” The movement in Britain gained steam this year after the mother of 16-year-old Brianna Ghey, who was killed by two teenagers last year, began demanding that kids under 16 be blocked from accessing social media on smartphones. “It feels like we all know (buying smartphones) is a bad decision for our kids, but that the social norm has not yet caught up,” Daisy Greenwell, a Suffolk, England-area mother of three kids under age 10, posted to her Instagram earlier this year. “What if we could switch the social norm so that in our school, our town, our country, it was an odd choice to make to give your child a smartphone at 11? What if we could hold off until they’re 14, or 16?” She and a friend, Clare Reynolds, set up a WhatsApp group called Parents United for a Smartphone-Free Childhood, with three people on it. She posted an invitation on her Instagram page. Within four days, 2,000 people had joined the group, requiring Greenwell and Reynolds to split off dozens of groups by locality. Three weeks after the original post, there was a chat group for every British county, one of the organizers said on WhatsApp. It’s an uphill climb Parents rallying to ban smartphones from young children have a long way to go to change what’s considered “normal.” By the time they’re 12, most children have smartphones, statistics from all three countries show. Look a little closer, and the numbers get starker: In Spain, a quarter of children have a cellphone by age 10, and almost half by 11. At 12, this share rises to 75%. British media regulator Ofcom said 55% of kids in the UK owned a smartphone between ages 8 and 11, with the figure rising to 97% at age 12. Ofcom added another statistic to their report last year: One in five toddlers, ages 3 or 4, owns a smartphone. Parents and schools that have succeeded in flipping the paradigm in their communities told The Associated Press the change became possible the moment they understood that they were not alone. What started as a tool to keep in touch with buddies has morphed into something more worrisome to keep away from kids — akin, these parents assert, to things like cigarettes and alcohol. In Greystones, Ireland, that moment came after all eight primary school principals in town signed and posted a letter last May that discouraged parents from buying their students smartphones. Then the parents themselves voluntarily signed written pledges, promising to refrain from letting their kids have the devices. “The discussion went away almost overnight,” says Christina Capatina, 38, a Greystones parent of two preteen daughters who signed the pledge and says there are almost no smartphones in schools this academic year. “If (kids) even ask now, you tell them: We’re just following the rules. That’s how we live.” For Mònica Marquès of Barcelona, no signed pledge was necessary to get the same result. She polled the parents of her daughters’ grade two years ago and she was surprised to see that “99% of them were as terrified or more so than I was.” She shared the results of her questionnaire, and says that this year, when her daughter started high school, not one student in her grade had a smartphone. And as for that other excuse that kids supposedly need a smartphone so parents can keep tabs on them, Marquès says an old-school cell phone without Internet access like the one her daughter carries is a perfect substitute. An increasing scrutiny Something like a consensus has built for years among institutions, , parents and others that smartphone use by children is linked to necessary for learning. China moved last year to of smartphones, while France has in place a for kids aged six to 15. The push to control smartphones in Spain comes amid a surge in notorious cases of children viewing online pornography, sharing videos of sexual violence, or even participating in creating “deep fake” pornographic images of female classmat es using generative artificial intelligence tools. Spain’s government says that 25% of kids 12 and under and 50% of kids 15 and under have already been exposed to online pornography. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said Spain is facing an “authentic epidemic” of pornography targeted at minors. The threats include adults taking advantage of minors they meet online, such as the recent arrest of two “influencers” in Madrid for having allegedly sexually assaulted underage girls who followed them on TikTok. The dangers have produced school bans on smartphones and online safety laws. But those don’t address what kids do in off hours. “What I try to emphasize to other principals is the importance of joining up with the school next door to you,” says Rachel Harper, principal of St. Patrick’s National School, one of the eight in Greystones to encourage parents to refrain from smartphones for their kids. “There’s a bit more strength that way, in that all the parents in the area are talking about it.” The parents’ concerns are diverse. Some fear the day when their young kids ask to get a phone like their friends. Others have young teens with phones and regret they followed the herd during what they consider a naïve phase when screens were just a way to let kids have fun and chat with their friends. Parents speak of having emerged from a state of blissful ignorance about the internet. The home isolation of the COVID-19 pandemic offered a firsthand glimpse of their kids staring at screens and getting clever about hiding what they were seeing there — and what was finding them. “The screens were seen as a escape valve that let adults work and kept kids occupied, whatever that meant,” says Macu Cristófol, who started a group of concerned parents in Malaga, in southern Spain, after she heard of the ballooning parents group in Barcelona. “That was when I thought, where are we going? We have become hostages of screens.” Capatina says she saw her 11-year-old daughter change the day she came home from a playground and shared that a girl there had recorded video of the scene on a smartphone. “Panic, panic, panic,” Capatina recalls of her daughter’s reaction. “Nothing really major happened,” Capatina says, “but I saw the pressure and anxiety levels increasing where they hadn’t before. And I thought, that’s not healthy. Children shouldn’t have to worry about things like that.” But if the kids can’t have smartphones, are the parents cutting back their own online time? That’s tough, multiple parents say, because they’re managing families and work online. Capatina, an interior designer, says she shows her kids what she’s been doing online — work, for example, or schedules — “to hold myself accountable.” Laura Borne, a Greystones mom of kids ages 5 and 6 who have never known smartphones, says she is aware of the need to model online behavior — and that she should probably cut back. “I’m trying my best,” she says. But just as with the children she parents, the pressures are there. And they’re not going away. ___ Kellman reported from London.","pubDate":"2024-06-21 05:11:25","image_url":"https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/thestar.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/78/678543e2-cddd-57bf-b468-3ec8407b4c57/66750c5b45ec7.image.jpg?resize=300%2C200","source_id":"thestar","source_priority":9555,"source_url":"https://www.thestar.com","source_icon":"https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/thestar.png","language":"english","country":"canada","category":"world","ai_tag":"social media and internet","ai_region":"barcelona,spain,europe,spain,europe,barcelona,barcelona,spain,europe","ai_org":"ap","sentiment":"neutral","sentiment_stats":"positive:0.3,neutral:97.66,negative:2.04"},{"article_id":"716084f0e59e607abc102ddf0537ff54","title":"PM Modi leads international Yoga day celebrations","link":"https://www.news18.com/videos/india/modi-yoga-8939524.html","keywords":"india","creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"PM Modi leads international Yoga day celebrations, celebrates Indias mindfulness gift to the world","content":"PM Modi leads international Yoga day celebrations, celebrates Indias mindfulness gift to the world","pubDate":"2024-06-21 05:11:23","image_url":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/06/world-digital-2024-06-21t102033.483-2024-06-11c0355ba6b558699d083e79a8b542e9-3x2.png","source_id":"news18","source_priority":6644,"source_url":"https://www.news18.com","source_icon":"https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/news18.png","language":"english","country":"india","category":"top","ai_tag":"awards and recognitions","ai_region":null,"ai_org":null,"sentiment":"neutral","sentiment_stats":"positive:0.68,neutral:99.19,negative:0.13"},{"article_id":"27f4fbb6a56a6589fb9f059a71fd50af","title":"10 most expensive homes sold in Union County, June 10-16","link":"https://www.nj.com/realestate-news/2024/06/10-most-expensive-homes-sold-in-union-county-june-10-16.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"A house in Summit that sold for $2.4 million tops the list of the most expensive residential real estate sales in Union County in the past week.","content":"A house in Summit that sold for $2.4 million tops the list of the most expensive residential real estate sales in Union County in the past week.

After the construction begins, one lane of the road under the Mahamaya flyover will be closed to vehicular movement. Updated: June 21, 2024 10:41 AM IST By Traffic jams in Noida will end soon as an underpass connecting Noida Jungle Trail Park to the Mahamaya flyover will open to the public soon. The construction of this underpass will start this week, according to an announcement made by the Noida authority. This underpass marks a significant step to enhance the connectivity to the new park close to the Okhla Bird Sanctuary. The Noida Authority said the construction of the new underpass will be completed in 6 months. After the construction begins, one lane of the road under the Mahamaya flyover will be closed to vehicular movement. The cars coming from Kalindi Kunj in Delhi towards Dalit Prerna Sthal will be restricted to a single lane, to make sure that traffic flow continues only with some delays. This underpass will become a crucial link for commuters, allowing them to commute seamlessly between different sections of the park. The Z-Tech India Private Limited is overseeing the construction of Noida Jungle Trail Park. The new underpass from Noida Jungle Trail is approximately seven meters wide and 24.40 meters long. This underpass is expected to be completed within five to six months at an estimated cost of Rs 2 crore. Noida traffic advisory has been issued for the construction period of the underpass and during this time, traffic police will manage the flow of vehicular movement to minimize disruptions. Cars coming from Kalindi Kunj towards Sector-95 Dalit Park in Noida will be restricted to one lane. Traffic police will be deployed during peak hours to make sure smooth traffic movement.

Those results mean that, whatever happens in Saint Lucia, these two are the favourites to qualify from the short Super 8s stage. But the honour of topping the group could be key to the semi-final layout - although there are certainly going to be no easy draws at the penultimate stage. England fans can also breathe a sigh of relief that today’s game does not take place overnight, having endured a 1.30am start last time out.

The woman involved had arranged to be picked up by the man, who she was in a relationship with, but he never arrived to collect her. The woman lodged a claim with the tribunal, which said that, in her view, the agreement for a ride to the airport constituted a legally binding agreement. Credit: AP As a result, she missed her flight and had to travel the following day. It was also arranged that he was to stay at her house while she was away and look after her dogs, which he did not do. The details of the case were released on Thursday, with the names of the couple redacted. The woman lodged a claim with the tribunal, which said that, in her view, the agreement for a ride to the airport constituted a legally binding agreement. She said she incurred costs to travel the following day, the cost of a shuttle to the airport and the cost to put her dogs into a kennel. The woman said she ended up paying for the fare and claimed the man would reimburse her. She added the man, whom she had been in a relationship with for over six years, entered into a verbal contract with her that he would take her to the airport and stay in her house while she was away. Tribunal referee Krysia Cowi said in a statement, “partners, friends and colleagues make social arrangements, but it is unlikely they can be legally enforced unless the parties perform some act that demonstrates an intention that they will be bound by their promises”. “When friends fail to keep their promises, the other person may suffer a financial consequence but it may be that they cannot be compensated for that loss,” she said. Ultimately, Cowie decided that although a promise was made, it fell short of being a contract, with the promises exchanged as a normal give and take in a relationship. As a result, Cowie dismissed the women’s claims. The couple have now separated.

Nvidia this week briefly became the largest U.S. company by market value on the back of a more than 1,000% surge in share price since October 2022. It is up 206% in the last 12 months. Nvidia bulls say more gains are coming. The Santa Clara, California company stands at the forefront of a massive technological shift as the dominant provider of chips to support artificial intelligence applications. Revenues are expected to double this fiscal year to $120 billion and rise to $160 billion in the following year. Microsoft, by comparison, is expected to grow revenues by about 16% for its fiscal year. The stock’s eye-popping performance is drawing in investors afraid of missing out on more gains. Yet it has also made Nvidia’s shares more richly valued: its forward price-to-earnings ratio, for example, has grown by 80% this year. That could make the company’s shares more vulnerable to sharp pullbacks when bad news hits. \\"What it's done in the past ... shouldn't be driving the investment decision,\\" said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services. \\"However, on a stock like Nvidia, it's awfully hard to have that not be a factor in the investment decision because you have this chasing feeling.\\" ONWARDS AND UPWARDS So far, Nvidia’s share price trajectory has rewarded bullish investors and punished doubters. The stock is up 164% in 2024, as its market value has surged to over $3.2 trillion, briefly putting it ahead of Microsoft and Apple this week. Optimistic investors point to Nvidia’s dominance of the AI-chip sector as a key reason for their bullishness. The high performance of Nvidia's chips makes them difficult to replace in AI data centers. Adding to this lead is its proprietary software framework that developers use to program AI processors. Ivana Delevska, founder and chief investment officer of Spear Invest, remains bullish on the outlook for Nvidia shares, as she expects upside to earnings beyond what Wall Street analysts are forecasting. Nvidia is the top holding in the Spear Alpha ETF, at nearly 14% of the fund. \\"If the (stock) price has gone up like it has but the earnings haven't really moved, yeah, we would be very worried,\\" Delevska said. But, \\"where we are here it has pretty solid earnings support.\\" Indeed, Nvidia’s forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 45 is only modestly higher than its five-year average P/E of 41, even after growing from 25 at the start of the year, according to LSEG Datastream. At the same time, that valuation is down from more than 84 about a year ago. Tom Plumb, president of Plumb Funds, said he believes the opportunity for Nvidia's chips beyond AI is underappreciated. The firm has held Nvidia shares for more than seven years and it is the largest position in its two funds. \\"What we really are talking about is data and access to data,\\" Plumb said. \\"And they have the fastest, smartest chip that allows that.\\" CAUTION AHEAD? Others have grown wary about Nvidia’s prospects of delivering stunning gains in the future. Nvidia has a \\"truly revolutionary\\" product and has posted \\"unprecedented growth,\\" said Gil Luria, an analyst with D.A. Davidson. However, he has a \\"neutral\\" rating on the stock and a $90 price target, compared with the stock's price of $130.78 on Thursday. Looking ahead several years, Luria said he doubts Nvidia's customers will spend enough to drive the Wall Street earnings estimates that support the company's valuation. \\"The caution on Nvidia comes from the longer-term outlook,\\" Luria said. \\"This type of performance is very hard to maintain.\\" Billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller said last month that he reduced his big bet in Nvidia in 2024, telling CNBC television that \\"AI might be a little overhyped now, but underhyped long term.\\" Carlson, of Horizon Investment Services, considers Nvidia a \\"buy,\\" but because of the stock's relatively expensive valuation, it would not make the cut to be included in Horizon's roughly 30-stock portfolios. Other concerns include eventual competition that erodes Nvidia's market-leading position. Tech giants Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Google-owner Alphabet are competing to build their AI computing capabilities and add the technology to their products and services. Analysts at Morningstar, which has a $105 fair value on the stock, said leading vendors such as Amazon, Microsoft and Meta Platforms will eventually seek to reduce their reliance on the company and diversify their supplier base. \\"Nvidia dominates AI today and the sky is the limit for the company’s profitability if it can maintain this lead over the next decade,” Morningstar's Brian Colello wrote this month. “However, any semblance of the successful development of alternatives could meaningfully limit Nvidia’s upside.” (Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Gerry Doyle)","pubDate":"2024-06-21 05:09:17","image_url":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/iY1NROG9KhW7XTiLb1yfKQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTY0MA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/reuters.ca/52b471994cd291f258b64a6eae618e2d","source_id":"yahoo","source_priority":17,"source_url":"https://news.yahoo.com","source_icon":"https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/yahoo.png","language":"english","country":"canada","category":"business","ai_tag":"financial markets","ai_region":"new york,new york,united states of america,north america,new york,united states of america,north america","ai_org":"nvidia corp,reuters","sentiment":"neutral","sentiment_stats":"positive:2.58,neutral:96.99,negative:0.43"},{"article_id":"e50be363996a882320c1a84c39ecb21c","title":"Claude 3.5 Sonnet: Anthropic AI Launches Its Most Intelligent Model Yet, Outperforms OpenAI’s GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Llama-400b; Check Details, Where To Access","link":"https://www.latestly.com/socially/technology/claude-3-5-sonnet-anthropic-ai-launches-its-most-intelligent-model-yet-outperforms-openais-gpt-4o-gemini-1-5-pro-and-llama-400b-check-details-where-to-access-6053507.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Anthropic AI has launched its most intelligent model - Claude 3.5 Sonnet with powerful capabilities.

The sun has decided to grace us with its presence and the mercury is gradually rising. According to the Met Office , the good weather is here to stay. Friday should reach balmy highs of 21C, while Saturday should have sunny intervals with highs of 19C (we won’t complain as that will seem tropical after the chilly conditions of late). Sunday will be another warm one, while lots of sunshine is forecast for the next week. Lovely stuff. Given this summer’s slow start, we really need to make the most of it and hit up one of Greater Manchester’s amazing parks, gardens and green spaces. There’s one which is only a stone’s throw away from the city centre yet offers gorgeous riverside views, towering trees and vast green lawns. READ MORE: The gorgeous Peak District hike named among best walk to do this summer The place in question is Peel Park, off the Crescent in Salford . Unless you live in the area you’ve probably never heard of it, making it one of Salford’s best kept secrets. Peel Park sits beside the River Irwell with a wide path running alongside it. It’s the perfect place for a stroll in the sunshine, with Manchester’s skyscrapers visible in the distance. The River Irwell flows beside the park (Image: MEN Staff) Approach the park from Salford Museum and Art Gallery and you’ll find several benches where you can take a seat and admire the view of the landscaped garden below, found at the southern end of the park. Take a slow wander down the sloping path, or descend the steps, and explore the gorgeous flower beds and winding paths. Enjoy a stroll in the sun (Image: MEN Staff) Peel Park has no shortage of lawn where you can roll out a picnic blanket and enjoy a spot of sunbathing or an alfresco meal. With towering trees overhead you can grab a spot in the shade, or choose a more sunnier location. An ice cream van often makes an appearance on sunny days, and there’s a playground for kids too. The vast lawn in the centre is a popular spot for ball games, while runners can be spotted completing laps around the edge. Peel Park is a half hour walk from Deansgate tram stop, or just a few minutes from Salford Central Station. There is some pay and display parking at Salford Museum and Art Gallery, and a bus stop right outside.

Pat Cummins (3-29) became only the fourth Australian to record a T20I hat-trick, joining forces with the in-form Adam Zampa (2-24) to restrict Bangladesh to 8-140 with the bat on Friday (AEST). Two separate rain delays interrupted Australia’s run chase, but the retiring David Warner (53 not out from 35 balls) ensured they were well ahead of the DLS par score when play was called off in the 12th over. Know the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today Mitch Marsh’s side finished at 2-100. The win means Australia are likely to progress to the final four at the North American tournament if they beat Afghanistan in their second of three Super Eight games on Sunday. Winning the toss, Australia had Bangladesh’s out-of-form batting order on the back foot when a classic full delivery from Mitch Starc (1-21) cleaned up Tanzid Hasan (0) three balls into the innings. But after that it was veteran tweaker Zampa who did the heavy lifting, twice breaking through as Bangladesh lost 3-26 either side of drinks. Zampa ended the 58-run partnership that had helped Bangladesh recover from the loss of Hasan, his delivery bouncing from the pad of a sweeping Litton Das (16 off 25 balls) and on to the stumps. The innings’ anchor early on and its eventual top-scorer, Najmul Hossain Shanto (41 off 36) did not even contemplate a review when Zampa struck his pad with the last ball of the 13th over. With that dismissal, Zampa moved into outright second for most wickets at the tournament (11), trailing only Afghan quick Fazalhaq Farooqi (15). Towhid Hridoy (40 off 28) breathed life into Bangladesh’s innings, but Cummins (3-29) saw to it that the underdogs never truly clicked into gear. He bowled Mahmudullah for two, then enticed Mahedi Hasan into finding Zampa at third man with the first ball he faced. With his opening delivery of the 20th over, Cummins had his hat-trick when Hridoy clipped him to a stretching Josh Hazlewood in the cordon. Cummins became only the fourth Australian to take a T20I hat-trick after Brett Lee, Ashton Agar and Nathan Ellis, and the seventh player of any nation to achieve the feat at a T20 World Cup. Chasing 141 for victory, Warner rode his luck after Hridoy dropped a tough chance while the veteran opener was on five runs in the second over. He and Travis Head (31) managed more sixes in the power play (four) than Bangladesh did for their whole innings (three) and were 0-64 when rain stopped play in the seventh over. But impressive leg-spinner Rishad Hossain (2-23) gave Bangladesh hope, bowling Head and then continuing Marsh’s lean run of form at the tournament. The Australian captain burned a review after being trapped lbw for one run. Warner flicked Taskin Ahmed for six over deep square leg to bring up his second half-century of the tournament before rain again forced the covers on. Roughly an hour had been lost to play when the game was called off after midnight (local time).","pubDate":"2024-06-21 05:07:45","image_url":"https://images.7news.com.au/publication/C-15097490/2e9da29f2347a1574afc2e2a96a3bf6815432ca0-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"7news","source_priority":7652,"source_url":"https://7news.com.au","source_icon":"https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/7news.png","language":"english","country":"australia","category":"top","ai_tag":"cricket","ai_region":"australia,australia/oceania,bangladesh,asia","ai_org":"aussies","sentiment":"negative","sentiment_stats":"positive:0.28,neutral:0.27,negative:99.46"},{"article_id":"8848fde690b12d47496090db2f6a2e30","title":"Grandfather falls ill in Turkey, leaving Brit family with £41,000 bill because he didn't have insurance","link":"https://www.dailystar.co.uk/travel/travel-news/grandfather-falls-ill-turkey-leaving-33076922","keywords":"travel","creator":"staronline@reachplc.com (William Morgan, James Rodger)","video_url":null,"description":"One British holidaymaker was left fighting for his life after falling ill in Turkey - and his family were forced to pay a whopping £41,000 medical bill to get him home","content":"Holidaymakers might want check they have the right travel insurance or they could risk forking out thousands, as one family did when they were hit with a whopping £41k medical bill.

Malcolm Stocker was whisked to intensive care at Ahu Hospital in Marmaris, where he spent nearly a month battling pneumonia and slipped into a coma.

McKee’s pledge of a wide-ranging review — following an earlier announcement that she would ease rules for gun clubs — was applauded by groups representing the country’s 250,000 license holders and decried by survivors of the 2019 terrorist attack at two Christchurch mosques where an Australian man opened fire on Muslim worshippers, killing 51 people. “It makes me scared for our futures,” Temel Ataçocuğu — who was shot nine times in the attack and fears an erosion of the assault weapon ban — told the AP. “What have the past five years been for? How are they going to prevent this from happening again?” New Zealand drew global admiration when its then-Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said six days after the massacre that her government would outlaw all semiautomatic weapons. The change , and : bolstered licensing requirements, more rules for gun clubs, and the creation of a firearms registry. The changes introduced “onerous regulatory compliance,” said McKee, whose political party, Act, campaigned for New Zealand’s 2023 election on a platform for reversing many of them. Now in government as part of a center-right coalition, McKee pledged to update the law before the next election in 2026. Her bloc has enough lawmakers to easily pass any reforms. Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and a spokesperson for Labour — New Zealand’s largest opposition party, formerly led by Ardern — have not answered AP requests for comment. McKee said she would consult with the public before deciding specific measures and that her personal views would not direct the overhaul. Critics rejected that. “She was elected as a gun lobbyist, that was her role,” said Chris Cahill, president of the Police Association, a group representing most New Zealand officers. “She’s got a loyalty to the gun lobby groups.” The review was “without a doubt, a backdoor into giving people access to semiautomatic assault rifles again,” Cahill said. At the time of the ban, McKee denounced it as “knee-jerk.” As a minister she is more guarded, but told the AP that New Zealand had not been entirely rid of such weapons; several hundred people have permits to use them for pest control in rural areas, while others can own but not fire them. “If we extend the access, what are the possible controls around the use of the extension? And would society be happy with what those controls mean?” McKee said she would ask during the review. “It’s about how do we find the balance with protecting people but not going over the top with a regulatory regime,” she said. Any concerns raised by opponents should be “realistic,” McKee added. “It cannot be anecdotal.” New Zealand’s gun laws were safer before the 2019 reforms, the minister said, citing the dozens of pages of information now required for a gun license as an example of changes that could deter gun owners’ compliance. “That’s absolute rubbish,” said Cahill. Gun laws , he added, and the scrutiny reported by owners in the years since reflected the proper administration of the law after an injection of government funds. McKee will begin by examining the gun registry created after the attacks; some gun owners want it shrunk to only the highest-powered weapons, rather than all guns. She will also explore removing from police oversight the new agency that administers gun licenses and registrations. Gun crime has increased in New Zealand since 2019, according to analysis of official crime figures by New Zealand news outlets. Supporters of the tighter restrictions say , and that a burgeoning problem with violent gang crime is fueling the rise. McKee, and groups representing gun owners, say scrutiny since the attack has fallen on law-abiding license holders at the expense of criminals, who are not captured by the stricter rules. The Council of Licensed Firearms Owners said members had lost or couldn’t obtain licenses because of malicious reports from past partners — who must be interviewed as part of a person’s application — or because they had divulged depression to their doctors. Areas of flexibility should be introduced to applications, spokesperson Hugh Devereux-Mack said. “Every single New Zealander who is not convicted of a serious criminal offense and has no sort of problematic behaviors or serious mental health conditions is eligible to own a firearm,” Devereux-Mack said. The gunman , Brenton Tarrant, moved to New Zealand from Australia, acquired a gun license and amassed a cache of assault weapons, all legally, without drawing the attention of law enforcement until he committed the massacre. The police were censured by Tarrant was incorrectly allowed to nominate a character reference who barely knew him because he did not have relatives in New Zealand who could be interviewed. McKee said the rules that followed have made the system rigid and unwieldy. She would prefer a licensing regime “that looked at the individual,” she said — without prompting the same disregard of rules that had allowed Tarrant to receive a license. Devereux-Mack said his group might support an additional practical testing component to gun licensing, and a tiered system with more freedoms for longtime license holders. “New Zealand won’t be safer if it becomes easier to get a gun,” Ataçocuğu said. “I have to have an eye test every time I renew my drivers’ license. Gun owners should have similar background and mental health checks every few years to make sure they’re still safe to have guns.”","pubDate":"2024-06-21 05:07:02","image_url":"https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/thestar.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/e4/0e44b1f0-378b-570e-a7e6-5f3e94363e9c/66750b295500a.image.jpg?resize=300%2C200","source_id":"thestar","source_priority":9555,"source_url":"https://www.thestar.com","source_icon":"https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/thestar.png","language":"english","country":"canada","category":"world","ai_tag":"politics","ai_region":"new zealand,australia/oceania,wellington,wellington region,new zealand,australia/oceania","ai_org":"ap","sentiment":"negative","sentiment_stats":"positive:0.11,neutral:0.25,negative:99.64"},{"article_id":"72bd47ef6db99edb22d75dc945370a66","title":"Flipkart Minutes, 15-Minute Delivery Vertical Entering Market: Reports","link":"https://zeenews.india.com/companies/flipkart-minutes-15-minute-delivery-vertical-entering-market-reports-2759268.html","keywords":null,"creator":"Zee News","video_url":null,"description":"As reports of Flipkart Minutes entering the Indian Market gains pace, Blinkit, Zepto, Instamart new competitor?","content":"As reports of Flipkart Minutes entering the Indian Market gains pace, Blinkit, Zepto, Instamart new competitor?

This brings the total to approximately $2 billion in GenAI deals for the first nine months of the current fiscal year, underscoring its robust growth in a rapidly evolving technological landscape. The company, operating on a September-August financial calendar, had won $100 million in pure-play GenAI projects in the year-ago period after it first quantified the deal value of the new technology in June last year. In the current fiscal year, Accenture had recorded $650 million and $400 million in during the second and first quarters, respectively. The third quarter saw Accenture's total order bookings hit $21.1 billion, with GenAI deals accounting for 4.3% of this total, a significant increase from the 0.6% share in the year-ago period. Read This: “With over $900 million in new GenAI bookings this quarter, we now have $2 billion in GenAI sales year to date, and we have also achieved $500 million in revenue year to date. This compares to approximately $300 million in sales and roughly $100 million in revenue from GenAI in FY23,\\" Accenture’s chair and chief executive Julie Sweet said in a post-earnings discussion with analysts on Thursday. “GenAI is acting as a catalyst for companies to more aggressively go after cost, build digital core and truly change the ways they work, which creates significant opportunity for us,\\" Sweet added. GenAI, which includes technology driving innovations like ChatGPT, spans a broad array of capabilities, including creating new content forms such as text, audio, and video. Competitive landscape and market position Accenture's early success in GenAI contrasts with homegrown technology services majors, such as Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, Infosys Ltd, and HCL Technologies Ltd, which are still navigating their AI strategies. Save for TCS, which claims to have bagged $900 million of AI deal wins last year, none of the technology services firms have disclosed their earnings from this technology, considered by many as the biggest risk to the outsourcing industry. More Here: “The $2 billion in bookings YTD (year to date) in FY24 compares to about $2.2 billion in Azure AI revenues in the prior three reported quarters through March 2024. Moreover, Accenture has generated about $500 million in revenues thus far in FY24 versus about $100 million in revenues in FY23,\\" Keith Bachman, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note dated 20 June. Arvind Ramnani and John Nutt, analysts at investment firm Piper Sandler & Co., had in December estimated that the GenAI business could become a $4 billion venture for Accenture in the current financial year. Accenture Q3 performance Amid ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties, Accenture’s revenue in the third quarter totalled $16.5 billion, marking a 0.6% decline from the year-ago period. The company revised its full-year revenue growth expectations to between 1.5% and 2.5%, down from an earlier forecast of 1% to 3% for the fiscal year ending in August 2024. Considering acquisitions contributing 3% to the company's annual growth, Accenture, which reported $64.1 billion in revenue last year, is experiencing a decline in organic growth. “Accenture’s results were good enough, given the backdrop of muted expectations,\\" Piper Sandler analysts Ramnani and Nutt wrote in a note on June 20. “We view management’s tone today as a 'tick-up' from 2Q.\\" “We note that GenAI-related work is still in the early innings and that projects remain relatively small in size. Despite this, GenAI continues to pull through AI readiness work as clients prepare their infrastructure to take advantage of the new technology.

Reports circulating in Indian media suggested that Sania Mirza, a former tennis star, might be planning to marry the fast bowler in the future. Imran Mirza, however, firmly dismissed these claims. In a statement to the media, he called the rumors unfounded and emphasized that Sania Mirza has never even met Mohammad Shami. He expressed his surprise and disappointment over such baseless speculation, which has stirred unnecessary chatter among fans and followers. The gossip mill first churned out these rumors with little to no evidence, sparking interest and debates across social media and various news outlets. The alleged link between Sania Mirza and Mohammad Shami caught attention quickly, given Sania’s high-profile status in sports and her past marriage to Pakistani cricketer Shoaib Malik. Imran Mirza’s comments come after a wave of rumors following the confirmed divorce between Sania Mirza and Shoaib Malik last year. The tennis star’s personal life has often been in the spotlight, and this latest speculation only adds to the ongoing public curiosity. For now, it’s clear from Imran Mirza’s words that there’s no truth to the rumors of Sania’s second marriage with Mohammad Shami. Fans and followers of both athletes can put these rumors to rest as they continue to focus on their respective careers.","pubDate":"2024-06-21 05:05:53","image_url":"https://enews.hamariweb.com/tpl_assets/2024/06/Web_Photo_Editor-5.jpg","source_id":"hamariweb","source_priority":9251,"source_url":"https://enews.hamariweb.com","source_icon":"https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/hamariweb.jpg","language":"english","country":"pakistan","category":"sports","ai_tag":"cricket","ai_region":null,"ai_org":null,"sentiment":"negative","sentiment_stats":"positive:0.09,neutral:0.18,negative:99.73"},{"article_id":"1086528fc5d670d34b3dba9a90185c6f","title":"Macquarie recommends private banks; upgrades Kotak, City Union Bank, and 2 more; downgrades SBI and 3 others","link":"https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/macquarie-recommends-private-banks-upgrades-kotak-city-union-bank-and-2-more-downgrades-sbi-and-3-others-11718944101966.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Macquarie advises sticking with private sector banks in India and avoiding PSUs, NBFCs, insurance, and fintechs. It upgrades Kotak Bank and City Union Bank, and downgrades SBI and NBFCs. SBI Life upgraded. Pair trades suggested. Private banks are expected to have healthy ROEs in the 16-18% range.","content":"Global brokerage house Macquarie, in a recent report, has advised investors that in the Indian financial space 'stick with private sector banks; avoid PSUs, NBFCs, insurance, fintechs.' Consequently, it has upgraded four stocks within the banking and financial space and downgraded ratings on four others. \\"Private sector banks are at attractive valuations and expected to report 16-18 percent ROE (return on equity) over the next few years. We would stay away from PSU banks, Insurance, and Fintechs owing to regulations, declining fundamentals, and/or unfavorable risk-reward,\\" it said. In the banking space, Macquarie has upgraded Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd and City Union Bank from 'Neutral' to 'Outperform', citing their underperformance over the past 12-24 months, which has led to attractive valuations and favorable risk-reward profiles. Conversely, it has downgraded State Bank of India (SBI) from 'Neutral' to 'Underperform' due to recent outperformance, impending ECL regulations, declining ROAs (return on assets) and ROEs (return on equity), and the potential need for an equity capital raise. Among NBFCs, Macquarie has downgraded , Cholamandalam, and M&M Finance from 'Neutral' to 'Underperform' among NBFCs, citing expectations of lower growth, declining ROEs, and a delayed rate cut cycle. In the insurance sector, while remaining cautious, the brokerage has upgraded SBI Life from 'Neutral' to 'Outperform', believing IRDA regulations less impact it. It expects SBI Life to achieve sector-leading VNB (value of new business) growth of 15 percent and considers its valuations reasonable in this context. Private Banks As per the brokerage, private sector banks are a steady power of compounding story. Despite a lower loan growth environment, it expects private sector banks to report healthy returns on assets (ROAs) and ROEs over the next three years and remain steady power of compounding stories. \\"We expect healthy ROEs in the 16-18 percent range. They are less affected by ECL regulations and carry contingent buffers (most of them) and we do not see any adverse asset quality outlook. A delayed rate cut cycle further cushions NIMs for them in the near term. We make marginal changes to our earnings estimates for private sector banks after their full-year numbers, and raise TPs for most of them as we roll our valuation-based models forward to FY26E, from FY25E,\\" it said. Meanwhile, for PSU Banks, Macquarie believes that the public sector lenders will see falling ROEs driven by normalisation of credit costs. There is additional risk of ECL impact which we are yet to factor in earnings, it added. Moreover, it expects life insurance companies to face lower VNB (value of new business) growth this cycle driven by falling margins. It also noted that NBFCs no longer have the advantage coming from rate cuts in the near term and the full impact of RBI regulations (increase in RWA) will be felt in terms of lower loan growth, margins, and return ratios in FY26E. Risk-reward is also unfavorable for some of the larger NBFCs, it stated. Macquarie's top picks and pair trades: : Axis Bank, IndusInd Bank, and HDFC Bank. : Shriram Housing Finance and : SBI Life. : 1) Long HDFCB, Short SBI; 2) Long SHFL, Short BAF; and 3) Long SBI Life, Short IPRU.

The actor has hung up his “ Yellowstone ” hat, ruling out a return to the long-gestating final episodes of the hit Paramount Network series. Costner, who has been on the promotional circuit for the first and second parts of his Western epic “Horizon,” made his decision known with a video on social media , filmed during the daytime but posted to his accounts on Thursday evening. “After this long year-and-a-half of working on ‘Horizon’ and doing all the things that that’s required — and thinking about ‘Yellowstone,’ that beloved series that I love, that I know you love — I just realized that I’m not going to be able to continue Season 5B or into the future,” Costner said in the video. “It was something that really changed me. I loved it and I know you loved it. I just wanted to let you know that I won’t be returning. I love the relationships that I’ve been able to develop. And I’ll see you at the movies.” The first eight episodes of “Yellowstone” Season 5 aired in the fall of 2022 and saw Costner back in the saddle leading the series as John Dutton. Now, after a long period of development and strike-related delays, the final six episodes are finally in production. With Costner currently tied up promoting “Horizon: An American Saga – Chapter 1” and its sequel, plus having already distanced himself from the series for over a year now and threatening to sue the show’s producers, a return already seemed unlikely at best. Paramount Network announced a Nov. 10 premiere date for the final episodes Thursday morning, hours before Costner made his continued absence official. Costner’s comments come just days after the actor floated a potential “Yellowstone” return “under the right circumstances” on Today . It was the latest of several suggestions made by the star that he would be interested in reappearing for the series’ final episodes. “Saying there’s a chance, there’s always a chance,” he said on the talk show. “I love the thing. You’ve got to be really clear about that.” Now, three days later, Costner has ruled out that chance.","pubDate":"2024-06-21 05:05:28","image_url":"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Yellowstone-KevinCostner.2.png?h=1000","source_id":"variety","source_priority":186,"source_url":"https://variety.com","source_icon":"https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/variety.png","language":"english","country":"canada","category":"entertainment","ai_tag":"celebrity","ai_region":null,"ai_org":null,"sentiment":"neutral","sentiment_stats":"positive:1.17,neutral:98.57,negative:0.27"},{"article_id":"0c402369d1a5da5f0dc54c8ebddffc5a","title":"Analysis-Consumer-focused lending under Labour could dent UK bank profits","link":"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysis-consumer-focused-lending-under-050521558.html","keywords":null,"creator":"Reuters","video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"By Sinead Cruise and Lawrence White LONDON (Reuters) - Once seen as hostile to banks, Britain's Labour has courted lenders in recent years as it attempts to gain power, yet some of the left-leaning party's policies are still expected to hit the sector's profits if it wins next month's election. Leader Keir Starmer has won plaudits among business-owners and financiers with promises of stability and a more balanced approach towards taxation of the financial and professional services sector, which contributed more than 110 billion pounds ($139 billion), or 12.3%, of total UK tax receipts in 2023. But the party is still expected to lean on the industry to improve the financial resilience of households and consumers, many of whom have suffered disproportionately from more than two years of mortgage market volatility and a cost of living crisis. Many lenders in Britain, including HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds Bank and NatWest, have reported record profits in the past two years. These have been bolstered by robust lending margins, low volumes of loan defaults and modest rates paid to savers on their deposits. Among the policies it has showcased in the run-up to the election on July 4, the Labour Party has said it will review the benefits of longer-term fixed rate mortgages to shield homeowners from steep changes in interest rates and make home ownership more accessible. That pledge is leading some analysts, lenders and brokers to suggest a Labour government could seek additional changes across mortgages and other financial products and services to tip the balance back in favour of consumers. \\"Traditional mortgage products place all the interest rate risk with borrowers,\\" said Arjan Verbeek, the chief executive of challenger bank Perenna. Compared to the United States, Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands, banks in Britain tend to offer a narrower range of long-term fixed rate mortgage products, which some lenders have attributed to low demand from borrowers wary of \\"missing out\\" on lower repayment costs when base rates fall. Longer term mortgages on fixed rates would give first time buyers greater security, but would come at a cost to providers, said Daniel Austin, CEO and co-founder of ASK Partners, a specialist lender to the property sector. \\"A 10-year fixed rate (mortgage) is always a lot more expensive, so the idea will not work if the cost of a 25-year fixed rate becomes prohibitive,\\" he said.Whereas in the U.S., banks can reduce their risks and costs by repackaging and selling longer-term mortgages, lenders in Britain offset such risks more often by taking out a form of protection known as interest rate swaps with a matching duration to the home loans, mortgage bankers said. That carries additional costs and the prices of such swaps have spiralled in the last two years amid political turmoil and rising inflation. Just 3% of UK residential mortgage deals available as of June 19 had a fixed initial term of 10 years or more, Moneyfacts data showed. A Labour Party spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. INTEREST While an incoming Labour government may lean on banks to widen their mortgage range, analysts and senior executives at big British banks agree it is now unlikely to pursue bank windfall taxes, a policy championed by the party's previous leader Jeremy Corbyn. Nor is it expected to overhaul how the Bank of England pays interest to banks on their deposits, another policy mooted in recent months by politicians, the sources said. Data published by the British parliament's cross-party Treasury Committee in May showed NatWest, Barclays, Lloyds and Santander UK received more than 9 billion pounds in interest in 2023 – a 135% increase year-on-year. \\"After years of low rates and sub cost-of-equity returns, banks are currently making normalised, rather than supernormal, profits,\\" RBC Capital Markets analyst Benjamin Toms said. \\"Labour looks to be taking a pro-growth stance which will be helpful for UK banks.\\" PROFIT PINCH Other Labour Party policies are likely to dent bank earnings potential over time, bank analysts and industry sources said. The party said this week it would \\"bring face-to-face banking back to the high street\\" with the opening of up to 350 'banking hubs' over the next five years - an initiative in conflict with most lenders' cost-cutting plans. These hubs, funded by the banks, will support communities reduced to \\"ghost towns\\" by branch closures, said shadow finance minister Rachel Reeves, with some 6,000 outlets shut since 2015. The party's Freedom to Buy scheme, its headline policy to help more Britons onto the housing ladder, is also unlikely to herald a new profit boon for banks. \\"It's expected to help 80,000 first time buyers over five years, which is not game-changing for banks in the context of mortgage volumes greater than one million per annum,\\" Toms said. Chris Irwin, Director of Savings at Yorkshire Building Society and Moneyfacts expert Rachel Springall said the industry and whichever party is in government needed to show customers how they could boost their finances by switching savings or mortgage products. The Financial Conduct Authority obliges finance firms to put their customers' needs first but more than 366 billion pounds of savings are stuck in low-interest accounts, costing savers more than 1,000 pounds in potential annual income, YBS data showed. \\"The main reason bank profits will fall is that rates will come down. But I also think bank profits will come under pressure in the credit card and current account markets once the fair value spotlight swings over to those sectors,\\" James Daley, managing director of Fairer Finance said.

The Aussie also reflected on the job’s complexity- interviewing fighters after commentating on the whole fight to pop right back in the octagon to catch exclusives all while maintaining an approachable tone. But none of that is an immediate concern for Whittaker. Because in just a few days time, he will be fighting Khamzat Chimaev’s replacement, Ikram Aliskerov, a fighter he claims to have never heard of before. While Whittaker is all set to face this new challenge, his former foe backed ‘The Reaper’ to beat the breaks off of Ikram Aliskerov. Israel Adesanya picks Robert Whittaker over Ikram Aliskerov Having met Whittaker in the octagon twice previously, former middleweight champion, Israel Adesanya knows a thing or two about what it takes to get past the Aussie. Initially slated to face Khamzat Chimaev, ‘Bobby Knuckles’ got on the grind, wrestling on the mat, ready to tussle a whale, which is why Izzy believes the new Dagestani challenge won’t be a problem for Whittaker at all. Dropping his thoughts on his popular YouTube channel , ‘The Last Stylebender’ placed his bets on his former foe and predicted that this will be a banger of a fight. Despite admitting that it would be a great opportunity for Aliskerov, the ‘Stylebender’ believes that if Bobby Knuckles picked up pace, this could be over by the 3rd round and with some gratuitous violence.","pubDate":"2024-06-21 05:04:48","image_url":"https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/06/a42f9514-untitled-design.jpg","source_id":"thesportsrush","source_priority":4166,"source_url":"https://thesportsrush.com","source_icon":"https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/thesportsrush.jpg","language":"english","country":"united states of america","category":"sports","ai_tag":"mixed martial arts","ai_region":null,"ai_org":"ufc","sentiment":"neutral","sentiment_stats":"positive:0.36,neutral:99.53,negative:0.11"},{"article_id":"8a478895eb49a22f4dcbde8013ef2e88","title":"ED moves Delhi High Court challenging bail granted to Arvind Kejriwal in excise policy case","link":"https://www.livemint.com/news/ed-moves-delhi-high-court-challenging-bail-granted-to-arvind-kejriwal-in-excise-policy-case-11718945874734.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Enforcement Directorate challenges Arvind Kejriwal's bail in money laundering case at Delhi High Court.","content":"The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on June 21 has moved the Delhi High Court in order to challenge the bail granted to Arvind Kejriwal in a money laundering case linked to a now-scrapped excise policy.

Akhmed Yakoob, 36, who loves fast cars and expensive jewellery, also told how he pulled his children out of secular state schools to avoid them being exposed to positive LGBT messages. Mr Yakoob, a criminal defence lawyer, is standing as an Independent in the Birmingham Ladywood constituency and has close links to George Galloway's Workers Party of Britain. In a video interview broadcast nine months ago, Mr Yakoob was introduced as 'the most famous solicitor in the world right now' by Mikey Melin, the host of YouTube documentary channel The Blue Tick Show. In the interview, Mr Yakoob said: 'What if a man goes into the ladies' bathroom and says, ''I'm not a man, I'm a woman''. 'Well if my wife's in there I'm sparking him out. And there ain't no defence for that offence.' Laughter followed before Mr Melin added: 'I would accept the time, f*** it, put me inside.' Akhmed Yakoob, 36, (pictured) who loves fast cars, is fighting to become Birmingham's new MP Mr Yakoob, a criminal defence lawyer, is standing as an Independent in the Birmingham Ladywood constituency Mr Yakoob claimed he and any Muslim cannot 'promote' positive LGBT issues because doing so is prohibited in their faith Today, Mr Yakoob insisted the comment in the video was not aimed at trans women, instead claiming: 'I was saying what if a big grown man who can clearly be seen is a man. That's the fear isn't it? 'Men who are not trans, who are normal men, will start taking advantage. It will give normal men who are predators the idea that they could get away with it.' Ladywood is home to the city's celebrated Gay Village. Liberal Democrat candidate Lee Dargue said it would be dreadful for the city and the LGBT community if the next MP for the area held such views. Mr Yakoob is hoping to unseat Labour 's shadow justice minister Shabana Mahmood and has built up a following among disaffected Muslims and people who support his pro-Palestine campaign messages.

In the interview, Mr Yakoob also claimed that he and any Muslim cannot 'promote' positive LGBT issues because doing so is prohibited in their faith - a claim that was condemned by some faith leaders, academics and gay Muslims. He also stated that he 'hates' LGBT equality messages being shared in schools, so much so that his own children were moved out of secular state schools to faith secondary schools. Speaking to Mr Melin, Mr Yakoob said: 'I've got no issue with this LGBTQ. I don't promote it. I can't promote it. You [Mr Melin] can't promote it, we can't promote it because we are Muslim. 'We can't promote it because it's been told, we've been told, God has sent down a message...people should be able to do what they like, yeah, but not try to enforce their views and opinions on other people's kids. I don't like this being taught in schools - I hate it.' Mr Yakoob added: 'I have now pulled my kids out of school. Now they are in Islamic schools because I can't have that around me. Regardless of what religion you are, a young girl or a young boy should not be taught about different genders that you can change your gender. He also stated that he 'hates' LGBT equality messages being shared in schools, so much so that his own children were moved out of secular state schools to faith secondary schools Mr Yakoob's videos have become popular on Instagram and TikTok 'If we say something bad about these (LGBTQ) guys, people go mad, but people are burning the Holy Quran - have you heard anyone say anything about that, condemn that? Nobody cares about that. 'That's our religious book [...] why are people just ignoring that? And somebody says bad about LGBTQ and the whole world goes mad - they are so annoyed about it and get frustrated so easily.' Mr Yakoob later clarified that his children had attended state primary schools but he moved them to faith schools when they went into the secondary sector, one attending an Islamic school and the other at a Catholic school. Ahead of his election campaigns, Mr Yakoob's videos have become popular on Instagram and TikTok using his catchphrase 'There's a defence for every offence'. He has 195,000 followers on TikTok and around five million likes. He polled nearly 70,000 votes in the recent West Midlands mayoral election. Earlier this year, Mr Yakoob was criticised when a misleading video he promoted, alleging a young teacher supporting a Labour candidate had used a racial slur, went viral. She had not said anything offensive but was bombarded with hate messages over the video after Mr Yakoob and others put her name and school into the public domain. He later apologised and is facing an investigation by the Solicitors Regulation Authority over his behaviour. In another video, Mr Yakoob also praised controversial influencer Andrew Tate as a 'good hearted man' who just wants 'men to be men'. The video interview went online after Mr Tate was charged with human trafficking, rape and criminal gang enterprise offences in Romania. Mr Tate, his brother Tristan and others accused deny all allegations. He has 195,000 followers on TikTok and around five million likes Mr Yakoob said he would represent Mr Tate given the chance, adding: 'I genuinely like that brother, I think he's a good, kind hearted brother who works hard and I'd go out of my way to help him....all he was doing and them brothers were doing was promoting hard work and telling men to be men, nothing wrong with that. 'People get offended too easily, people are soft these days.' Mr Yakoob said today he did not believe he had said anything offensive in the video interview. Mr Yakoob said: 'My view on LGBTQ people is this; I have no issue with any community. I love all communities and everyone has a right to co-exist and live in peace and harmony with each other.' But he said he maintained it was wrong to 'sexualise' children from a young age, adding: 'My view about children being taught it (about the existence and equality of LGBT people) is correct, children should be left to grow up by themselves, and their innocence should be protected, and they shouldn't be taught about any sexualization.' Challenged on what evidence there was of schools 'sexualising' children, he referenced story books available in some schools, saying they were confusing. Books in some local primary schools include ones featuring a child with two mummies, two boy penguins who nurture an abandoned egg and raise the baby penguin together, and a boy who likes to wear a dress. Mr Yakoob said: 'Some boys or some girls don't have that much intellect compared to others and that information (in story books) could be misinterpreted by a seven or eight year old boy.' He claimed a worried Roman Catholic father had recently approached him to ask for his help over the same issue and was 'really pleased' to hear he could move his child to another school or home-school them. On his admiration for Mr Tate, Mr Yakoob said: 'I don't agree with everything Andrew Tate says - I agree with what he says about working hard to make something of yourself.' On the charges facing Mr Tate, he said only that 'I believe that someone is innocent until proven guilty'. He also spoke on a second recorded podcast interview in which he has come under fire for 'joking' about domestic violence against women. The commentary was part of an unedited version of the Minted Mind podcast, hosted by Birmingham-based entrepreneur Abdhul Zaman. In it six male voices are heard exchanging views on the role of women and whether men should do more to 'keep them in their place'. At one point Mr Yakoob joins in laughter and 'jokes' during a discussion about women dancing on TikTok as one of the podcasters states: 'Getting back to masculinity, I personally would give her a backhander. I'm not joking.' Mr Yakoob 'jokes' about the legal defence that could be framed in such a circumstance. The comments have been widely criticised. Councillor Nicky Brennan, equalities cabinet lead at Birmingham City Council, said: 'One in four women are victims of domestic abuse in their lives, on average two women die a week at the hands of violent men. It's nothing to joke about.' Today, Mr Yakoob said of the response: 'Everyone is on a learning curve and everyone makes mistakes. We learn things daily. I'm on a learning curve. And if I have upset anyone by taking part in that podcast, I apologize and if I have upset anyone, it's unintentional.' The podcast features Mr Yakoob saying that '70 per cent of hell would be women'. Asked about this today, he claimed he was quoting a Muslim 'hadith' that states: 'The majority of the dwellers of the fire are women.' Mr Yakoob added: 'It was a quote...it's not something I made up, you can research it.' He also said he stood by a belief expressed in the podcast about divided gender roles. Mr Yakoob said: 'I do believe that at home I'm the king, I go out and get my hands dirty, do the work, and my wife is the queen, looking after the children and the household. I actually feel that, it's true, my wife is my queen. Why should she go outside and get her hands dirty when I can do that?' Asked if people of diverse backgrounds, women, and the LGBT community could trust him to represent them, Mr Yakoob said: 'Every single constituent of Ladywood is equal in my eyes, and is allowed to co-exist with each other. 'And if they have any issues, my doors are open to every single constituent, whether they are Muslim, Christian, Jewish, Sikh, Hindu, black, white, Chinese, whatever community they're from, LGBT, I don't want to cause division.'

State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller said this in response to a query seeking his comments on recent exchanges that took place between Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi over the latter’s securing a third term as the premier. “We value our important relationships with both India and Pakistan. As we have said, we support direct discussions between India and Pakistan, but the pace, scope and character should be determined by those two countries, not by us,” said Miller. PM Shehbaz on June 10 congratulated Modi on taking oath as the Indian PM. Modi, in response, thanked Shehbaz. Shehbaz’s elder brother and former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, also felicitated the Indian PM. “Let us replace hate with hope and seize the opportunity to shape the destiny of the two billion people of South Asia,” he advised Modi. The Indian PM in his response said, “The people of India have always stood for peace, security and progressive ideas.” “Advancing the well-being and security of our people shall always remain our priority,” he added. Meanwhile, addressing the department’s press briefing, the State Department spokesperson said the US and Pakistan had a shared interest in combating threats to regional security. “We partner with Pakistan on security through our high-level counterterrorism dialogue, including several counterterrorism capacity-building programs, and we support a series of US-Pakistan military-to-military engagements,” he said. He was asked about Pakistani Ambassador to US Masood Khan’s statement that Pakistan needed modern American weapons to fight the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), as the terror outfit is “using American weapons against Pakistani military forces that were left by US forces in Afghanistan”. Miller said, “We are in regular communication with the Pakistani leaders as a part of our partnership on CT issues, and we will continue to discuss regional security in detail, including through our annual counterterrorism dialogue and other bilateral consultations.”","pubDate":"2024-06-21 05:04:00","image_url":"https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2024-06-21/l_550272_094704_updates.jpg","source_id":"geo","source_priority":4637,"source_url":"https://www.geo.tv","source_icon":"https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/geo.png","language":"english","country":"pakistan","category":"top","ai_tag":"government","ai_region":"washington,missouri,united states of america,north america,washington,connecticut,united states of america,north america,washington,maine,united states of america,north america,united states of america,north america,washington,illinois,united states of america,north america,washington,georgia,united states of america,north america,washington,virginia,united states of america,north america,washington,north carolina,united states of america,north america,washington,vermont,united states of america,north america,pakistan,asia,india,asia,washington,pennsylvania,united states of america,north america,washington,kansas,united states of america,north america,washington,new jersey,united states of america,north america,washington,utah,united states of america,north america,washington,iowa,united states of america,north america,washington,united states of america,north america,washington,indiana,united states of america,north america,washington,west virginia,united states of america,north america","ai_org":"state dept,state department","sentiment":"neutral","sentiment_stats":"positive:0.12,neutral:99.79,negative:0.09"},{"article_id":"3201f43ac870f7ced97eafcd9c195d11","title":"Ask Amy: After MeToo reflection, should I apologize to my female friend?","link":"https://www.masslive.com/advice/2024/06/ask-amy-after-metoo-reflection-should-i-apologize-to-my-female-friend.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"\\"I know there are other men who have been even guiltier than I, but they have never apologized. Do I need to?\\"","content":"Dear Amy: Several years ago, I was involved in projects with a female friend (I’m a man). I occasionally made jokes and said things that in retrospect I realize were inappropriate. She finally set me straight. Then Covid and the MeToo movement hit, and I had time to revisit a number of things that at the time I felt were innocent remarks or actions, but were in fact wrong. We have since become friends again, but I occasionally think that I’d like to apologize for every time I made her uncomfortable. I know there are other men who have been even guiltier than I, but they have never apologized. Do I need to? Would my apologizing now, years later, be just for my benefit – or would it be a kind gesture to a good friend? – Conflicted Dear Conflicted: Other people doing worse things than you have done should not enter into your equation. You cannot justify your own choices by finding negative examples to compare yourself to. There is no downside for you to apologize to your friend for mistakes, “jokes” or comments you made years ago. She called you out at the time, and your friendship took a hit, but seems to have recovered. Maya Angelou said it best: “Do the best you can until you know better. Then when you know better, do better.” An apology would definitely benefit you, and offering forgiveness (if necessary) would also benefit her. You say that your friend “set you straight” at the time and that your friendship suffered. Opening up a discussion and offering her your current perspective and understanding – along with an apology – will help both of you to close the loop on this and move forward with greater understanding and intimacy. Dear Readers: The following Q&A first ran in 2020. Dear Amy: My family and I came to America from the Soviet Union when I was a teenager. We became citizens. I got educated here and own a successful business. I write well and speak correctly, with almost no accent. I feel like I am an American. I love America, and try to learn new things every day, but I feel like something is missing in me. Since I spent my formative years in a communist country (truly like another planet, compared to the USA), my “autopilot” reactions are not like those of typical American-born people. For instance, my manners, topics of conversation, humor, dress, attitude toward money, and even body language can seem “foreign.” I feel like it is hurting me to be “culturally different.” I don’t think I say or do anything straight-up offensive – it’s more like a lot of little things. How can I fix this “handicap”? I would love to know how to be more American, but I can’t find any books or courses on the subject. – NOT Born in the USA Dear NOT: As we approach the celebration of another Independence Day, I appreciate this unusual and provocative question, which, honestly – has no “correct” answer. First, I urge you not to see your own cultural background and habits as a “handicap,” but as an asset. Yes, America is a country. But America is also really a series of concepts, experiments, and experiences. It is no one thing. But here is a beautiful “American” ideal (so different from the culture you were raised in): All Americans have the right to be uniquely themselves, and that definitely includes you. However, reinvention is baked into the American experience, and so if you want to affect “American” mannerisms, I suggest you become a student of American culture. Take a history course at your local community college. Follow up with a class on cinema and popular culture. Read Mark Twain, Edith Wharton, Sherman Alexie, Gary Shteyngart, and Jericho Brown. Listen to Dolly Parton. Watch “Singing in the Rain,” “Goodfellas,” “Barbershop,” “13 th,” and “Ramy.” Become a volunteer firefighter. Teach English as a second language to other newer citizens (teaching American concepts to others will show you how much you actually know). Work at your local polling station during the next election. When you say or do something you believe is “off,” ask a friend to break it down for you. They might choose to tell you what I’m trying to tell you now – which is that your effort makes you the most “American” person they know. Dear Readers: R. Eric Thomas is starting a new advice column.

U.S. companies are assessing their prospects in China as its economy recovers unevenly and relations worsen between the two nations. For banks, sluggish capital markets have weighed on activity in China, and investors are watching the effect of government support measures on the economy. \\"The business environment in China has been challenging in recent years, but sentiment began turning more bullish in March,\\" Erdoes said in an interview at the bank's headquarters in New York. China's consumer spending is showing some signs of recovery, and while the country is still grappling with real estate problems, the government is looking at ways to fix those, both \\"positive signs\\", she said. Erdoes, one of four executives recently identified by the bank's board as a potential successor to CEO Jamie Dimon when he eventually steps down, visited China last month to present at an annual Global China summit hosted by the bank in Shanghai. Attendance increased from last year to more than 3,000 delegates from across 33 countries as clients sought to gauge whether to revive their investments in China, she said. \\"Long-term investors know and understand that China is a very important market, and we are continuing to grow and expand our business there,\\" she said, without giving further details. JPMorgan became the first foreign owner of a brokerage in China in 2021 and its asset management unit in China employs 400 people. It has been among those to cut jobs in the country this year, Reuters reported last month. Dimon said last month in Shanghai that parts of its investment banking business in China had \\"fallen off a cliff\\" in recent years, the Financial Times reported. Erdoes, whose business manages more than $5 trillion of assets, in September convened a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and U.S. billionaires in New York to discuss investment in Ukraine, a country she has visited four times. The lender has offered advice to Zelenskiy on economic policies and growth, and Erdoes assembled more billionaires in Davos, Switzerland in January to discuss aid and investment opportunities in Ukraine after the war with Russia ends. \\"We are working on development issues critical to their rebuilding efforts and exploring ways to connect clients to business there once a peaceful resolution is hopefully reached,\\" Erdoes said. The World Bank estimates Ukraine may need almost $500 billion to rebuild its economy. Erdoes has taken a personal interest in the country, traveling with her family, including her three daughters, to Poland to volunteer at an orphanage for Ukrainian children in 2022. She and her family raised more than $92,000 for charities supporting Ukrainian families, according to a fundraising site that the bank confirmed was set up by her family. SUCCESSION Dimon, who has run the biggest U.S. lender for more than 18 years, said he plans to step down in less than five years. Along with Erdoes, other contenders identified for the top job are Jennifer Piepszak and Troy Rohrbaugh, co-CEOs of its commercial and investment bank, and Marianne Lake, CEO of consumer and community banking. If JPMorgan appoints a woman as CEO, she would be only the second female head of a major Wall Street bank after Citigroup's Jane Fraser was appointed in 2021. \\"Building a diverse workplace is not something that you do in a day,\\" Erdoes said. \\"We have been on this journey for multiple decades.\\" (Reporting by Nupur Anand in New York; Editing by Lananh Nguyen and Jan Harvey)","pubDate":"2024-06-21 05:02:42","image_url":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/_PNi3X7Y3XRWhVJgjHo2hA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTY0MA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/reuters.com/1d10f943e8ca381c29b29a15f40d419d","source_id":"yahoo","source_priority":17,"source_url":"https://news.yahoo.com","source_icon":"https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/yahoo.png","language":"english","country":"canada","category":"business","ai_tag":"banking and finance","ai_region":"china,asia,new york,new york,united states of america,north america,new york,united states of america,north america","ai_org":"jpmorgan chase,reuters","sentiment":"positive","sentiment_stats":"positive:98.59,neutral:1.11,negative:0.3"},{"article_id":"dae87eac0ab893ca0df001ae8842cccd","title":"Pat Cummins hat-trick sets up Australia for soggy T20 World Cup win over Bangladesh","link":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jun/21/australia-vs-bangladesh-t20-world-cup-cricket-results-scores-match-report","keywords":"twenty20,bangladesh cricket team,cricket,t20 world cup,sport,t20 world cup 2024,australia sport,australia cricket team","creator":"Australian Associated Press","video_url":null,"description":"Bangladesh 140-8; Australia 100-2 | Australia win by 28 runs (DLS)Bowler takes just seventh hat-trick in men’s T20 World CupsAustralia are knocking on the door of the Twenty20 World Cup semi-finals after beginning the Super Eight stage with a convincing 28-run win over Bangladesh in rainy Antigua.Pat Cummins (3-29) became only the fourth Australian to record a T20I hat-trick, joining forces with the in-form Adam Zampa (2-24) to restrict Bangladesh to 140-8 with the bat.

Pat Cummins (3-29) became only the fourth Australian to record a T20I hat-trick, joining forces with the in-form Adam Zampa (2-24) to restrict Bangladesh to 140-8 with the bat. Two separate rain delays interrupted Australia’s run chase, but the retiring David Warner (53 not out from 35 balls) ensured they were well ahead of the DLS par score when play was called off in the 12th over. Mitch Marsh’s side finished at 100-2. T20 World Cup 2024: Australia beat Bangladesh by 28 runs – as it happened Read more The win means Australia are likely to progress to the final four at the North American tournament if they beat Afghanistan in their second of three Super Eight games on Sunday. Winning the toss, Australia had Bangladesh’s out-of-form batting order on the back foot when a classic full delivery from Mitch Starc (1-21) cleaned up Tanzid Hasan (0) three balls into the innings. But after that it was veteran tweaker Zampa who did the heavy lifting, twice breaking through as Bangladesh lost 3-26 either side of drinks. Zampa ended the 58-run partnership that had helped Bangladesh recover from the loss of Hasan, his delivery bouncing from the pad of a sweeping Litton Das (16 off 25 balls) and on to the stumps. The innings’ anchor early on and its eventual top-scorer, Najmul Hossain Shanto (41 off 36) did not even contemplate a review when Zampa struck his pad with the last ball of the 13th over. With that dismissal, Zampa moved into outright second for most wickets at the tournament (11), trailing only Afghan quick Fazalhaq Farooqi (15). Towhid Hridoy (40 off 28) breathed life into Bangladesh’s innings, but Cummins (3-29) saw to it that the underdogs never truly clicked into gear. He bowled Mahmudullah for two, then enticed Mahedi Hasan into finding Zampa at third man with the first ball he faced. With his opening delivery of the 20th over, Cummins had his hat-trick when Hridoy clipped him to a stretching Josh Hazlewood in the cordon. Cummins became only the fourth Australian to take a T20I hat-trick after Brett Lee, Ashton Agar and Nathan Ellis, and the seventh player of any nation to achieve the feat at a T20 World Cup . skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Spin Free weekly newsletter Subscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s action Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He and Travis Head (31) managed more sixes in the power play (four) than Bangladesh did for their whole innings (three) and were 64-0 when rain stopped play in the seventh over. But impressive leg-spinner Rishad Hossain (2-23) gave Bangladesh hope, bowling Head and then continuing Marsh’s lean run of form at the tournament. The Australian captain burned a review after being trapped lbw for one run. Warner flicked Taskin Ahmed for six over deep square leg to bring up his second half-century of the tournament before rain again forced the covers on.

(KABC) -- Summer heat is on the rise and for many workers in Southern California it can be a miserable time of year. Especially for warehouse workers. \\"Now that it is getting hotter, I am even more worried about myself and my coworkers. I have seen some people faint from the heat,\\" said Carrie Stone, who works at an Amazon warehouse in Moreno. Warehouses operators like Amazon say the company has climate-control measures in place - but they may soon have to do more. On Thursday, the California Occupational Safety and Health Standards Board unanimously passed heat standards titled Heat Illness Prevention in Indoor Place of Employment. \\"This is really significant. Up until now workers have not had these rights or protections and there has not been clear guidance to employers about what they need to do to keep workers safe,\\" said attorney Tim Shadix with the Warehouse Workers Resource Center. The nonprofit warehouse workers advocacy group was one of several to speak in favor of indoor heat regulations. The new rules require employers to provide heat safety training, cooling areas and water when the indoor temperature reaches 82 degrees. If the temperature exceeds that, then required measures can include cooling devices, adjustments in work schedules, more breaks and slower production pace. \\"In my last job as a pastry chef, I suffered from heat illness due to extreme indoor heat,\\" said Colleen Koperek with the Restaurant Opportunities Centers United. \\"I was dry heaving in between taking rounds of pastries out of the oven and I had to quit, effectively ending my career,\\" said Koperek. Koperek is now a restaurant worker advocate who spoke to the board before the vote. Unlike warehouse workers, kitchen employees experience year-round sweltering temperatures. While the indoor heat regulations have the support of employee groups some business advocates worry the regulations would be hard to implement for some businesses. \\"We do remain concerned about the feasibility for small employers, particularly those who don't control the physical structure their business is in if you rent space to create the required cool-down zones,\\" said Robert Moutrie, policy advocate for the California Chamber of Commerce. Moutrie said the business community did support many of the measures to ensure employee safety. The Heat Illness Prevention in Indoor Place of Employment standards will now go before the Office of Administrative Law (OAL) which has 30 days to review it. However, the CAL OSHA board has asked the agency to expedite the matter in order to have the heat regulations in place sooner.","pubDate":"2024-06-21 05:02:10","image_url":"https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/14982542_062024-kabc-5p-indoor-heat-rules-vid.jpg","source_id":"abc7","source_priority":2347,"source_url":"https://abc7.com","source_icon":"https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/abc7.png","language":"english","country":"united states of america","category":"environment","ai_tag":null,"ai_region":null,"ai_org":"cal,osha","sentiment":"neutral","sentiment_stats":"positive:0.1,neutral:99.79,negative:0.11"},{"article_id":"23f93a864ac992a4d09fd52989332568","title":"IMF's roadmap for Europe: Prioritising green investment and market integration","link":"https://www.euronews.com/business/2024/06/21/imfs-roadmap-for-europe-prioritising-green-investment-and-market-integration","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The IMF recommends Europe implement strategic macroeconomic policies, structural reforms, and increased green investment to address challenges such as reduced fiscal buffers, an ageing population, and low productivity growth.","content":"The IMF recommends Europe implement strategic macroeconomic policies, structural reforms, and increased green investment to address challenges such as reduced fiscal buffers, an ageing population, and low productivity growth. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has released its 2024 Concluding Statements on Common Policies for member countries, highlighting both the progress and the persistent challenges facing the euro area economy. Following the disruptions caused by the pandemic, Russia’s gas supply halt, and the ongoing war in Ukraine, the region is gradually recovering. Inflation rates are moving towards target levels, and banks have demonstrated resilience amid rising interest rates. Nonetheless, significant challenges persist, such as reduced fiscal buffers, an ageing population, and sluggish productivity growth. The IMF's recommendations focus on implementing strategic macroeconomic policies and structural reforms to foster growth and stability. The IMF forecasts modest growth for 2024, with further strengthening in 2025, driven by higher real wages and household savings reductions. \\"Increasing real wages and some drawdown of household savings are expected to contribute to a consumption-led recovery,\\" the IMF notes. However, long-term growth may be hindered by demographic trends and low productivity. Inflation is expected to reach target levels by the second half of 2025, aided by previous monetary policy tightening and falling commodity prices. Despite this positive outlook, growth risks remain, particularly from potential external shocks such as geopolitical tensions and reduced global demand. The IMF warns that \\"growth can also be lower due to adverse external developments, such as intensifying geopolitical tensions.\\" According to the IMF's World Economic Outlook released in April 2024, the Euro Area is projected to experience a 1.4% growth in 2024, with inflation anticipated to average around 3%. The IMF advises the European Central Bank to gradually ease its monetary policy based on incoming economic data. The IMF states, \\"continued, gradual monetary easing would achieve a balance between keeping inflation expectations anchored and avoiding an overly restrictive policy stance.\\" In June, Frankfurt reduced its main interest rates by 0.25 percentage points. However, it did not commit to further rate hikes, stressing a “meeting-by-meeting” and data-dependent approach. Boosting productivity and achieving climate goals are critical for long-term economic health. The IMF calls for increased investment in digital technologies, administrative reforms to reduce barriers for businesses, and greater labour market flexibility. \\"Europe’s economy faces low productivity growth, which will be increasingly problematic as adverse demographic trends intensify,\\" the IMF warns. Further integration of financial markets is essential for Europe to meet its goals for energy security, climate change mitigation, and digital transformation. An integrated capital market would facilitate financing for innovative projects and improve the allocation of savings within the European Union. The IMF advocates for \\"strengthening ESMA’s ability to coordinate across national authorities and greater harmonization of financial markets oversight.\\" Enhancing the EU budget to better target public investment is another priority. The IMF suggests establishing a Climate and Energy Security Facility (CESF) to address long-term challenges effectively. This facility would support EU emissions reduction goals and facilitate investments in energy infrastructure and clean-tech sectors. Climate policy should account for fiscal, efficiency, distributional, and cross-border impacts. Meeting emissions reduction targets requires significant investment, reducing fossil fuel dependence, and boosting energy efficiency to enhance competitiveness. However, short-term costs could arise, the IMF warns. According to the Washington-based institution, Member States should prioritise strengthening the single market and avoid distortive industrial and trade policies that could harm the economy and provoke retaliation. Labour market policies should aim to enhance skills, ease labour reallocation, and counter the effects of a shrinking workforce. Initiatives such as reskilling programmes, unemployment benefit reforms, and support for female labour force participation are essential. The IMF highlights the need for \\"fostering mobility across the EU through faster recognition of professional qualifications and more portable pension and social security benefits.\\"","pubDate":"2024-06-21 05:02:09","image_url":"https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/08/51/97/10/1200x675_cmsv2_405433ea-cc76-5be7-9251-865b3ce6655e-8519710.jpg","source_id":"euronews","source_priority":3311,"source_url":"https://www.euronews.com","source_icon":"https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/euronews.png","language":"english","country":"montenegro,bosnia and herzegovina,cyprus,united kingdom,albania,malta,ireland,macedonia,spain,moldova,france,germany,san marino,switzerland,poland,netherland,hungary,italy,belgium,austria,greece,russia,sweden,norway,portugal,romania,serbia,bulgaria,czech republic,latvia,lithuania,slovakia,slovenia,ukraine,andorra,kosovo,liechtenstein,finland,monaco,vatican,belarus,denmark,estonia,luxembourg,croatia,iceland","category":"top,top,top,top,top,top,top,top,top,top,top,top,top,top,top,top,top,top,top,top,top,top,top,top,top,top,top,top,top,top,top,top,top,top,top,top,top,top,top,top,top,top,top,top,top,top","ai_tag":"renewable energy,energy","ai_region":null,"ai_org":"imf","sentiment":"neutral","sentiment_stats":"positive:2.14,neutral:97.66,negative:0.2"},{"article_id":"75e341d9c984e10a5c80f4b630bc2f62","title":"Families get a sneak peek at new-look carvery pub with indoor and outdoor play areas as opening date revealed","link":"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink-news/families-sneak-peek-new-look-29378692","keywords":"food & drink","creator":"newsdesk@men-news.co.uk (Emma Gill)","video_url":null,"description":"The popular pub has undergone a huge transformation and families say they 'can't wait' to visit","content":"Families say they 'can't wait' to try out a newly-refurbished pub with both indoor and outdoor play areas. Previously Applewood Farm pub, on the border of Salford and Wigan in Astley, the place has been transformed into Farmhouse Kitchen and it's not just the signage that's changed. While the venue is still owned by Greene King, customers have been told it's 'an all-new brand and carvery experience' featuring 14-hour slow roasted meats, unlimited veggies and bottomless gravy. Read more: The 'Rolls Royce' of M6 service stations was so good we went twice The new signs are up (Image: Manchester Family / MEN) As well as the carvery, there'll be a new Kitchen cafe, with 'signature cakes, freshly-baked sweet and savoury pastries, and unlimited, self-serve coffee'. One of a chain of similar Farmhouse Inns, including Barley Farm in Eccles , Salford; Pine Tree Farm in Over Hulton, Bolton ; and Ash Tree Farm in Ashton , Tameside ; Applewood had started to look somewhat dated over recent years. But the concept of a pub with space for children to play both inside and out is a popular one with young families, especially one that serves up breakfasts, carvery and its famous Cakeaway desserts too. The inside is brighter and much more modern (Image: Manchester Family / MEN) The company has given us a sneak peek showing the inside of the new-look pub, which features a fresher, brighter dining area, carpets replaced with modern wooden flooring and the old dark furniture replaced with colourful orange and blue chairs and comfy sofa seating. Images have also been shared on social media giving customers a tiny glimpse of what to expect, with the opening date announced as Monday, July 8. Many responded to the post saying how excited they are to visit once it reopens. A glimpse of the new indoor play area being built at the site (Image: Manchester Family / MEN) \\"Can’t wait to bring my twin grandsons,\\" said one. \\"They are obsessed with Applewood, every Monday dinner we used to come, can’t wait for the re-opening.\\" Another said: \\"I just can't wait for you to open again.\\" Greene King says the 'improved menu' will include 'a combination of great value roasted, carved and baked dishes, giving guests more of what they love from the Farmhouse Inns offering'. Nuala Gallagher, brand director said: “We believe everything tastes better when we’re together, which is why we can’t wait to bring our Farmhouse Kitchen offering to the public. The new carvery area (Image: Manchester Family / MEN) “We aim to marry up people’s love for a carvery with all the delights of a classic café, creating a space where there is something for everyone to enjoy, with a hugely varied menu that offers great value. “This is such an exciting new space to step into, we look forward to welcoming local family and friends, and to see them pulling up a chair at a Farmhouse Kitchen table later this summer.” We've been given a sneak peek at the inside of the new Farmhouse Kitchen (Image: Manchester Family / MEN) When booking online, customers will be able to select a table in 'main dining', 'family dining', or 'family dining near to play area'. Standard carvery will cost £8.99 Monday to Friday, £11.99 on Saturday and £13.99 on Sunday and bank holidays. Small carveries will cost £6.49, £8.99 and £11.49 respectively.

The much-loved children's book character has been revealed as the theme for this year's Giant Maize Maze at York Maze and opens on July 13. The attraction has shared a number of photos to promote the event, but is keeping an aerial shot of the maze under wraps until the opening date. Read more: Chester Zoo launches half price tickets for special summer event The giant maize maze opens at York Maze next month (Image: York Maze) If previous years are anything to go by, with mazes themed around everything from Harry Potter and Star Wars to Lego and the Lion King, families will have a real treat in store as the venue marks 25 years of The Gruffalo story, written by Julia Donaldson and illustrated by Axel Scheffler. Creating the maze is no easy feat. Every year farmer Tom Pearcy cuts out over 5km of pathways in his 15-acre field (the equivalent of eight football pitches) and plants more than a million maize seeds. It's only when the crop is fully grown by mid July that the image is fully formed and can be viewed from the air, a bit like crop circles. Star Wars was the theme for 2017's maze (Image: York Maze) “I used to love reading The Gruffalo to my children,\\" said Tom. \\"It is something that appeals to grown-ups too. My design celebrating 25 Years of The Gruffalo has been cut out using GPS technology to plot the pathways. It is nerve wracking because I can’t tell if I’ve made a mistake and put a path in the wrong place until July when the maize plants are fully grown and the final image is revealed.” Alex Sanson, senior brand manager for The Gruffalo at Magic Light Pictures, said: “We are so excited to see The Gruffalo as a maize maze as part of his 25th birthday celebrations. \\"The Gruffalo’s Child is also featured in the design as she is marking 20 years this year. We hope that families in the local area will love exploring the Gruffalo Maize Maze and enjoy celebrating this special birthday!”. Families have to navigate the maze of pathways in the crop to find the six viewing platforms and the special photo points featuring the animals in The Gruffalo story. There's lots more at the attraction, including a Volcorno for kids to climb up and slide down (Image: York Maze) As well as the giant maze, the place is home to a number of smaller corn mazes, including the Jurassic Maze, featuring some life-sized dinosaurs. There's a Maze of Illusions, with all sorts of mind bending puzzles and illusions; a Mineshaft Maze, a 3D labyrinth of crawl tunnels, bridges and overhead walkways; a Sunflower Fortune Maze, which involves colouring the ends of your fingers at different stations; and the Musical Maze, with the sound of drums, xylophones, tubular bells and more guiding you through it. There's loads more to enjoy at the venue too, including more than 20 different rides, attractions and shows. There's a climbing frame, an inflatable Cobstacle Course, a giant Popcorn Pillow, Corn Snake Tower slides, a Volcorno for kids to climb up and slide down and loads more. The attraction also has a Jurassic Maze among its smaller corn mazes (Image: York Maze) The maze opens for the summer on Saturday, July 13 and remains open until September 2. Tickets can be booked online . You can get early bird tickets from £19.50 each for a set date. The most popular tickets are the 'advance flexible' tickets where you book for a certain date, but can swap to a different date if your plans change. These cost £22.50.

So he waits for his coach, Byron Moore, to signal commands from a lane usually to his right, and a shout of “let’s go!” after the pistol.","content":"When Eric Gregory crouches into the starting blocks, his coach will be right next to him. It’s the best way for the 400-meter sprinter to ensure a fast start. Because Gregory can’t really hear the starter’s commands or sometimes the starter’s pistol. Gregory lost a majority of his hearing as a kid. So he waits for his coach, Byron Moore, to signal commands from a lane usually to his right, and a shout of “let’s go!” after the pistol. The system is working to perfection. Gregory is coming off his third straight Division III national title competing for Gallaudet University. He earned spot No. 35 out of 35 in the 400-meter field for the first round Friday at the U.S. Olympic track and field trials. To make it here, though, is only part of his plan. He’s eager to make a big impression. “The only way people are going to respect us or look at us and see who we are is we’ve got to put in the work,” Gregory said in an interview conducted with the help of his coach and Sam Atkinson, the school’s associate athletic director for communications. “Just because we can’t hear, it doesn’t mean we can’t do. We have feet, we have hands, we can smell, we taste, can see, it doesn’t matter. You’ve got to do it.” Gregory grew up in Louisiana and started losing his hearing when he was around five-years-old. Gregory said the reason isn’t known: It could’ve been due to an illness. Or it could’ve been the result of a childhood accident when he and his brother were wrestling and he fell on his head. He has 25 per cent hearing in his right ear and 35 per cent in his left. He wears hearing aids, but not typically in a race. Because if the wind is blowing, it distorts any sort of sound. That’s why he relies on Moore, the coach at Gallaudet in Washington, D.C., a global leader in the education for deaf and hard of hearing students. Moore got a heads-up on Gregory from Tony Tatum, a standout football player at the school who now works on the recruitment side for students and athletes. Tatum told Moore about this high schooler he might want to check out. Already fast, Gregory just kept getting faster under Moore’s supervision. Gregory set the U.S. Deaf Collegiate Record in the 400-meter dash (45.73) at the NCAA Division III national championships in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, earlier this month. That time had a chance to earn him a lane at trials. “I looked at the list last week and it said, ‘Accepted,”” said Moore, who said he’s been told he will receive a special credential to get him on the track. “My whole body started shaking.” Gregory will be in Lane 2 on Friday in the second of five heats. The final is Monday, with the top three making the U.S. Olympic team for the Paris Games. “We all want to see success come from this weekend,” Moore said. “Not just a thing where it was a publicity stunt or a mercy acceptance, but the fact he can come in here and do well, that’s the goal.” The coach and sprinter are in sync on the track. For the “on your mark” command, Moore raises his hand and waits for him to get into the blocks. He puts his hand down to eye level. On “set,” Moore pulls his hand back. Gregory then waits for the pistol to sound before leaving the blocks with Moore yelling, “Let’s Go!” to spur him on. The only hiccup is if an electric starting sound is used instead of a starting pistol. That’s hard for Gregory to hear. The tandem have been told that at trials a starter’s pistol could be used for his heat. If not, Moore will be there to assist. For some of his athletes, Moore will pound the track at the start. The only time the start has been a real challenge was at a meet Gregory’s freshman year, when Gregory didn’t get into a set position — crouching into the blocks — because he didn’t hear the command. The race went off anyway. “Had a few words with the starter after that,” Moore said. Gregory was adamant that he’s not operating from a disadvantage in an event where fractions of a second can make all the difference. “If you can do it, you can do it,” Gregory said of running fast. All he wants is a lane and a chance to compete against the likes of Michael Norman, the 400-meter champion at the 2022 world championships held at Hayward Field. “I’m racing with the big dogs,” said Gregory, who wants to follow in the footsteps of Moore and become a coach one day. “I’m racing somebody that’s able to put me in a position to grow and learn and get better.” Gregory studies video and races all the time, sending clips to Moore at all hours of the night. “He worked hard to be here,” Moore said. “He deserves to be here among these great athletes. He’s ready to show the rest of the world what he can do.” Comments Related stories Related Topics","pubDate":"2024-06-21 05:01:54","image_url":"https://ss-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/ebb9l3/article68315327.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/US_Track_Trials_Athletics_Deaf_Sprinter_97919.jpg","source_id":"sportstar","source_priority":2972,"source_url":"https://sportstar.thehindu.com","source_icon":"https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/sportstar.png","language":"english","country":"india","category":"sports","ai_tag":"sports","ai_region":null,"ai_org":"olympic","sentiment":"neutral","sentiment_stats":"positive:9.96,neutral:68.0,negative:22.04"},{"article_id":"29d9eb3e17a58ee481e137191298e8d8","title":"Watch: MSNBC host spars with guest in heated debate over Trump and Business Roundtable","link":"https://www.rawstory.com/stephanie-ruhle-msnbc/","keywords":null,"creator":"Daniel Hampton","video_url":null,"description":"MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle sparred with one of her guests Thursday night in what became a tense exchange about former President Donald Trump's meeting with business leaders in the nation's capital.Amanda Carpenter, a writer and editor at the organization Protect Democracy, appeared as a panelist on the show to discuss Trump's political and financial support post-conviction.

Bailey charged \\"radical progressives in New York [for] trying to rig the 2024 election,\\" according to Fox News . \\"We have to stand up and fight back.\\" When Bragg ran for Manhattan district attorney in 2021 it was on a platform of “justice and public safety.\\" And when he was asked about the criminal investigation into Trump and how Cyrus Vance Jr., the outgoing DA didn't bring a formal charge, Bragg expressed his intentions. “I don’t know where this investigation will go. I don’t want to prejudge it. But, these types of investigations — white-collar investigations — I’ve been involved with for years, both doing them myself and also supervising them,” he said at the time. The lawsuit comes weeks ahead of a primary where Bailey is fighting to keep his AG post in a fierce GOP contest. Come Aug. 6, voters will decide to stay with Bailey or put their support behind Will Scharf, Trump's attorney who has been a mainstay in the news counterpunching for the gag-ordered convicted presidential contender.

Trump’s presidential campaign, the Republican National Committee and an allied super PAC raised over $170 million in May , The Washington Post reported Thursday night. That includes a massive haul following Trump’s felony conviction May 30 — the Trump campaign said it hauled in $53 million online in the 24 hours following his guilty verdict. The main super PAC supporting Trump MAGA Inc. was reportedly flushed with $69 million last month and had $94 million in cash. That number notably included a $50 million donation from reclusive heir Timothy Mellon , which marked one of the largest ever disclosed single donations. MAGA Inc. also received a $10 million bump from Richard and Elizabeth Uihlein, as well as $5 million from Kelcy Warren.

The GOP windfall took a chunk out of the Biden campaign’s once-massive fundraising lead. Now, the GOP reportedly plans to spend big on media buys through the summer. The Biden campaign hasn't yet filed its report but said it raised $85 million last month. The president's team said it had $212 million in cash heading into June.

Trump was responding on the podcast to a comment from one of its hosts, who said, \\"We need high-skilled workers in this country.\\" Another chimed in, noting that three of the four hosts are immigrants. \\"Can you please promise us you will give us more ability to import the best and brightest around the world to America?\\" a host asked, prompting Trump's green card response. Trump said he did promise that, adding that it was \\"so sad when we lose people from Harvard, MIT, from the greatest schools, and lesser schools that are phenomenal schools, also.\\" The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for further comment on his position.

And that is usually a complicated and expensive ordeal, involving the payment of thousands of dollars to an Egyptian company that can get Palestinians on an approved travel list to cross the border. Palestinians flee the southern Gaza city of Rafah during an Israeli ground and air offensive. Credit: AP Confronting the company’s stiff fees, as well as widespread hunger in Gaza, where there is no end in sight to Israel’s military campaign, many Palestinians have resorted to trying to raise money with desperate appeals on digital platforms such as GoFundMe. Dr Salim Ghayyda, a pediatrician in northern Scotland, posted one such plea in January after his sister texted from Gaza to say that their father had suffered seizures. Their father made it to a hospital and survived, but Ghayyda, 52, who left Gaza in 2003, said the episode convinced him he had to evacuate his family at any cost. “I thought I’d go to sleep one night and wake up to the news that my family is gone,” he said. “I felt helpless and hopeless, but I knew I had to do something.” Palestinians fleeing from the southern Gaza city of Rafah during an Israeli ground and air offensive in the city in May. Credit: AP Over the past eight months, an estimated 100,000 people have left Gaza, Diab al-Louh, the Palestinian ambassador to Egypt, said in an interview. Though some got out through connections to foreign organisations or governments, for many Palestinians, exiting Gaza is possible only by way of Hala, a firm that appears to be closely connected to the Egyptian government. Now the future of that avenue is uncertain, especially after the Israeli military launched an offensive against Hamas in Rafah and took over the crossing there, leading to its closure in May. No Palestinians have been allowed to pass through it since, and it is unclear when it will reopen. The New York Times spoke to a dozen people inside and outside Gaza who were either trying to leave the territory or to help family members or friends to do so. All but one spoke on the condition of anonymity over fears of retaliation by the Egyptian authorities toward them or their relatives or friends. Other pathways out of Gaza exist, but many of them require large payments, too. One route is to pay unofficial middlemen in the enclave or in Egypt, who demand $US8000 ($12,000) to $US15,000 per person in exchange for arranging their departure within days, according to four Palestinians who had either made the payments or had tried to. Palestinians connected to international organisations and governments, holders of foreign passports or visas, wounded people and some students enrolled in universities outside Gaza have been able to leave without paying large fees, but most of the more than 2 million people in the enclave do not fall into those categories. Hala charges $US5000 to co-ordinate the exits of most people 16 and older and $US2500 for most who are below that age, according to seven people who have gone through this process or tried to do so. Officials at Hala did not respond to questions sent by email. But Ibrahim al-Organi, whose firm, Organi Group, has listed Hala as one of its companies and who describes himself as a shareholder, disputed that the company charged those amounts. He said children travelled for free and adults paid $US2500. He said that amount was necessary because the service Hala provides is a “VIP” one and he said operating costs had skyrocketed during the war. Al-Organi, a tycoon with a history of helping the Egyptian government fight extremists in the Sinai Peninsula, maintains close connections to top Egyptian officials, according to three people who have tracked the relationship and who spoke on condition of anonymity to protect their work in the region. He denied he was benefiting unfairly from his connections. One man who lives in a tent on the beach in Deir al Balah, a city in central Gaza, said he felt as if he was dealing with war profiteers because he was being financially squeezed during the most vulnerable time of his life. He felt he had no option but to register with Hala. The man, 48, has to raise money for his wife and seven children, some of whom have to pay the adult fare. That means he needs $US37,500, he said, but he has come up with only $US7330 on GoFundMe so far. “What’s the alternative? There is none,” he said. Hala makes people go through a complicated bureaucratic process to register family members. The company requires a family member to visit its offices in Cairo and pay for the service in $US100 notes issued in or after 2013, according to Ghayyda and three other people with knowledge of Hala’s payment process. Al-Organi denied knowledge of the practice and said those who paid in $US100 notes had been scammed by illegal brokers. In February, when Ghayyda travelled to the Egyptian capital to register his parents, sister and nephew, he brought his 23-year-old son with him to avoid carrying more than $US10,000 by himself. By that time, he had raised around $US25,000. “The whole process was quite time-consuming, complex and uncertain,” he said. In an interview at his office in Cairo, al-Organi spoke at length and in detail about Hala’s activities, though he said his role in the company was limited and that he was just one of many shareholders. Hala has long been listed on Organi Group’s website as one of the conglomerate’s companies but the reference appeared to have been removed recently. Organi Group did not respond to a request for comment when asked why they had removed Hala from their website. Al-Organi described Hala as a tourism company, “just like any company that exists at an airport”, and he said it had been set up in 2017 to provide VIP services to Palestinian travellers who wanted an upgraded experience crossing through Rafah. “I help them only when they want to get into the VIP hall, to have breakfast, to be driven to Cairo in a nice BMW, to have a rest stop, and then go on to their destination,” he said. “Our role is to provide the best service possible, that’s it.” Multiple Palestinians who used Hala’s service during the war said they were not offered a VIP service: They were driven to Cairo in a minibus and were given basic food. Al-Organi said increased wartime demand for services such as the drive from Rafah to Cairo had forced the company to raise its prices. When asked about the accusations against Egypt cited in this story, the Egyptian government referred the Times to previous comments made by Egyptian officials, including Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry. Shoukry in February told Sky News he did not condone Hala’s collecting $US5000 in fees and said Egypt would take measures to eliminate the fees. The Egyptian government did not respond to a request for comment on its relationship with Hala. In a statement in mid-May, GoFundMe said more than $US150 million had been contributed to fundraisers related to the war in Gaza and that about 19,000 campaigns had been created on its platform, including for evacuations, medical care and food. The contributors include friends, relatives and their social networks, but also strangers without direct connections to those promoting the fundraisers. In April, Ghayyda, the pediatrician, travelled to Egypt a second time, this time to reunite with his parents, sister and nephew, who had just made it out of Gaza in time for Eid al-Fitr. He was overwhelmed with joy, but he still felt an enormous burden: 28 close relatives remained trapped in Rafah and Gaza City, and his parents would need to start a new life in Cairo, at least until the war ended. (In May, he secured the release of four more family members.) “It’s bittersweet,” he said. “It meant the world to me to see my parents, sister and nephew. But I am still consumed by constant fears about my family that’s still in Gaza. I won’t be able to feel like I can breathe normally again until I know they’re safe.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times .","pubDate":"2024-06-21 05:01:22","image_url":"https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4052%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_879%2C$y_323/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/00c852539b0768e8e9ee8295cb84e4630b6e74ed","source_id":"smh","source_priority":6729,"source_url":"https://www.smh.com.au","source_icon":"https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/smh.png","language":"english","country":"australia","category":"world","ai_tag":"politics","ai_region":"gaza,west bengal,india,asia","ai_org":null,"sentiment":"positive","sentiment_stats":"positive:98.97,neutral:0.78,negative:0.25"},{"article_id":"9274c7d0b801244d57b27660b982eb72","title":"10 most expensive homes sold in Wayne County, June 10-16","link":"https://www.mlive.com/realestate-news/2024/06/10-most-expensive-homes-sold-in-wayne-county-june-10-16.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"A house in Grosse Pointe Farms that sold for $2.8 million tops the list of the most expensive residential real estate sales in Wayne County in the past week.","content":"A house in Grosse Pointe Farms that sold for $2.8 million tops the list of the most expensive residential real estate sales in Wayne County in the past week.
